Time ago - as you may have already read on this blog here - I started to experiment with the GME API. The result of my experiments was <a href="http://newsmapper.googlemashups.com/">News Mapper</a> (more <a href="http://juri-strumpflohner.blogspot.com/2007/10/now-in-two-weeks-after-my-successful.html">here</a>). Today, when scrolling over the <a href="http://gallery.googlemashups.com/">Google Mashup Gallery</a>, I found "<a href="http://india-news.googlemashups.com/">India News</a>". It does basically the same as News Mapper, with the difference that it displays just news from India.<br />However just by looking at the page without touching it, one can see the similarity with my News Mapper project. With similarity I'm not referring to the conceptual part. Taking a look at the code approved my suspicion... Most of the code is completely identical to my code I've used for News Mapper. Lets look at some examples. The screenshot below shows for instance that<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R2Kl5GNH0jI/AAAAAAAAAxw/d_uDy71wn6I/s1600-h/indiaNews1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R2Kl5GNH0jI/AAAAAAAAAxw/d_uDy71wn6I/s400/indiaNews1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5143856124747305522" border="0" /></a> the author is using the same mechanism for laying out the different categories of the news feed. To realize this he uses the same CSS stylesheet class "category" with the same a:hover entry and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">same </span>color. His site is basically a slightly modified copy of my source code (even the comments of the JavaScript methods are the same :D )!<br />Moreover I don't think he has really understood my code since he calls for instance on each load <span style="font-weight: bold;">my</span> method called "cleanRSSEntries()" although it is completely useless for his situation. I've just needed it to cut out all HTML code that was inside Reuters RSS feeds because it lead to problems in displaying the information on the map. His feed provider however doesn't include HTML tags in the RSS feed at all.<br />The same author - with the name "Karthik" - also published another mashup <a href="http://cnntop.googlemashups.com/">http://cnntop.googlemashups.com/</a> where the copying of my source code is even more visible. You can compare the source codes if you want, however I don't think you have to. The similarities are too evident. Anyway:<br /><ul><li>News Mapper source code (my project): <a href="http://newsmapper.googlemashups.com/index.gml">http://newsmapper.googlemashups.com/index.gml</a><br /></li><li>India News: <a href="http://india-news.googlemashups.com/index.gml">http://india-news.googlemashups.com/index.gml</a><br /></li><li>CNN News: <a href="http://cnntop.googlemashups.com/index.gml">http://cnntop.googlemashups.com/index.gml<br /></a></li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >Copyright violation</span><br />News Mapper is licensed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache 2.0</a> license.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R2L622NH0kI/AAAAAAAAAx4/y_d4FqhaROw/s1600-h/newsmapperCopyright.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R2L622NH0kI/AAAAAAAAAx4/y_d4FqhaROw/s400/newsmapperCopyright.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5143949544580960834" border="0" /></a>Point 4 of the license refers to the redistribution saying the following:<br /><p><b><a name="redistribution"></a></b></p><blockquote><p><b><a name="redistribution">4.

It is not a nice way as the author <span jstcache="49" xmlns="" class="gm-control" name="control" jsvalues="$x:google.mashups.App.addControl($this,'gm:text','gmd:author',this);" ref="gmd:author" style="padding-left: 3px;" _ln="82">(Karthik</span>) has done it. :)
