Some time ago on the Blogger blog...<br /><blockquote><br /><div class="buzzEntry"> <div class="title"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Blogger and Picasa Web Albums</span> </div> <div class="content"> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/1640/3/400/737334/picasaweb-blogger-album.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Ever wanted to see all the photos you've uploaded to your blog in one place? Head over to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">Picasa Web Albums</a> and now you can! We've been working closely with the Picasa team on this project - all the photos you've uploaded since December will appear in an album there, and we're working on migrating your older photos as well. (It'll take a while though - there are a <span style="font-style: italic;">lot</span> of them.)<br /><br />Each of your blogs now has its own album in Picasa Web Albums, which is exciting because you now have a photo management interface for your blog's photos - for example you could <a href="http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=55871">order prints</a>, use the fancy <a href="http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=39501">email this photo</a> feature, or easily <a href="http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=44571">embed the album</a> somewhere else on the web. Be careful when you delete photos though, because deletions will affect both your blog and its album. Lastly, Blogger photos are now part of Picasa Web Albums' 1GB of free quota, which can be <a href="http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=39567">upgraded</a>.<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> and <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/">Picasa Web Albums</a>! </div> <div class="info"> â€” <span class="author">   Eric Case    </span> <span class="date"> [3/8/07 5:14 PM]<br /><br /><br /><br /></span> </div> </div>  </blockquote><br />Did you also wonder, where this album should be?? The problem is if you're not located in the US or in other countries where English is spoken. Your default language settings may then be set to your mother-tongue. If you set your language settings (usually in the settings panel) to "English US" the album should become visible. This is the case for most Google Services. New features are only immediately available with that language setting.
