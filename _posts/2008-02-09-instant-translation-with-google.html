Although living in Italy (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=39100+Bolzano,+Italy&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=12&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=0">South Tyrol</a>), my native language is German and still I prefer to write my blog in English - as you see. First of all that's because I studied Computer Science at the University in English and it's therefore much more intuitive to use it for the mostly technical stuff on this blog here.  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R61sKtn7maI/AAAAAAAAA-0/klVEydfY-D4/s1600-h/languageGadget.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R61sKtn7maI/AAAAAAAAA-0/klVEydfY-D4/s400/languageGadget.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5164903278965397922" border="0" /></a> Secondly it renders everything much more international which addresses a much bigger amount of people. And finally I can keep my English-knowledge a little up-to-date, now after the University.<br />Well, why am I telling you all these things? As you may have noticed, I placed a language gadget on the upper right corner of my blog. It allows to instantly translate it in a series of different languages for those who either don't understand English or just want to read everything in their native one. I tried it out for those languages I personally know (German and Italian) and it works quite well, although the construction of the sentences is not always correct. The overall result however is really good - meaning one understands also in the translated result what was the message of the post.<br />Just try it out, although I still suggest you to read my blog in its original language :) For more services around translation just check out <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate_t">Google Translate</a>.
