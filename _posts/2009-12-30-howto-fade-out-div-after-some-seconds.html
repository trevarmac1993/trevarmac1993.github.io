<p>Today I made a quick change to my blog. I don't know whether many of my readers noticed the possibility of expanding the reading area by clicking on the gray vertical bar which separates the left column with the post content.</p>

Therefore, what I wanted to change was to automatically hide the left navigation bar after a certain amount of time and so to give maximum focus on the written content, which is, after all, the most important part :) .<br />Shouldn't be a problem with jQuery and so the first Google query brought me directly to StackOverflow (who wonders ;) ). The raised&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/536502/how-can-i-fade-out-a-div-using-jquer">question</a>&nbsp;there&nbsp;is exactly what I needed, I was however not really satisfied by the accepted answer. Its author suggests to use the jQuery's <code>fadeOut</code> method<br /><pre class="prettyprint">$("#myDiv").fadeOut(5000);</pre><br />This however does not cause a delay of 5 seconds but specifies the timespan of the fade-out process itself. Being not satisfied about the answer I went ahead in search of an alternative and came up with this solution, which btw is actually a workaround. What I did is to make use of the "fadeTo" method which allows takes two parameters:<br /><ol><li>The speed of the process of "fading to". One can indicate milliseconds as well as semantic names like "slow".</li><li>The percentage of opacity, where 1 = 100% opacity.</li></ol><div>I specified it like<br /></div><pre class="prettyprint">$("#sidebar-column").fadeTo(15000,1).fadeOut(1000);</pre>So the process starts immediately and for 15 seconds it fades (an already 100% opaque container) to 100% opacity, i.e. nothing changes. This to simulate the delay. Then the fadeOut will start for a timespan of 1 second. Voil√†. You have your delay. Now, of course you can find the "correct" solution, using other jQuery plugins which have been made just for the purpose of creating a delay (like pause(...) ?) etc.<br /><br />The mentioned solution has some advantages which I'd not disregard:<br /><ul><li>it is a simple one-liner</li><li>you don't need any additional plugins</li></ul><div>Here's my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/536502/how-can-i-fade-out-a-div-using-jquery/1980197#1980197">SO contribution</a>.<br /></div>
