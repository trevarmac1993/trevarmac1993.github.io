<p>Erik DÃ¶rnenburg answers: What is Enterprise and Evolutionary Architecture?, discussing 4 issues: Turning strategy into execution, Ensuring conformance, Where do the architects sit? Buying or building?</p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Questions-for-an-Enterprise-Architect" imageanchor="1" rel="lightbox" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="322" rel="lightbox" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n8dGzoGkp4k/T1FBNk_DCnI/AAAAAAAAC9A/Z_Qob7uTCUY/s400/evolutionaryArchitecture.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />A very <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Questions-for-an-Enterprise-Architect" target="_blank">nice talk I'd like to share here</a> on the blog. It's essentially about architecture, especially targeting enterprise architecture, the do's and don'ts etc.<br /><br />A nice quote regarding the often mismatched metaphor about the "architects" role:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">What I want to call myself but couldn't get it through our departments was...I wanted to call myself a gardener. I'm sowing seats and I'm growing new plants and I am tending to them, making sure they're alright, making sure they have enough water. Some are more easy, some more difficult. [...] The gardener metaphor works much better than the architects metaphor but it doesn't sound as cool.</blockquote>It really should be like that. An architect should be one trying to use his competencies to make things easier, to help solve problems at a higher level, but at the same time he should "eat his own dog food" (it is this like you're saying it, right?). <b>Imposing</b>&nbsp;an architecture at a high level, forcing it to be implemented is completely non-sense. An architect needs to work with the system he designs, basically he needs to experience it.
