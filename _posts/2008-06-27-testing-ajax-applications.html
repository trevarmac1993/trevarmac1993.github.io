Testing the correct functioning of an application is a major issue in software development. Errors happen and cannot (always) be prevented upfront. There are however some approaches to filter bugs already during development<br /><ul><li>Unit testing<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> (at the method level)</span></span><br /></li><li>Integration testing <span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(at module level: testing "unit-tested" modules)</span></span><br /></li><li>System testing <span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(at system level: GUI, usability, performance, security, stress testing...)</span></span><br /></li><li>Acceptance testing <span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(testing by the customer (preferably not a developer); popular in Agile software development s.a. XP)</span></span><br /></li></ul>I don't want to go into detail on all of these. Just <a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;=&amp;q=Software+testing&amp;btnG=Google+Search">google</a> for it to find more infos. The reason for writing this post is that the Google test engineering team has started a series of posts on <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com">their testing blog</a> where they plan to describe Ajax testing in depth. Some of you may be interested so check the link:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/06/taming-beast-aka-how-to-test-ajax.html">http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/06/taming-beast-aka-how-to-test-ajax.html</a></span><br /></div>
