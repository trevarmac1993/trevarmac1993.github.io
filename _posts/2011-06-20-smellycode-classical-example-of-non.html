<p>I know there might be some degree of repetition in my posts when I speak about unit testing and mocking, but I always again come over similar problems in code I'm reviewing. Most often the core problem is that the responsibilities among different entities are not clearly separated which in turn makes testing complex or even impossible.</p>

In the following, I demonstrate a classical example I recently found in our codebase. The <b>requirement</b> was that you should be able to <b>validate an Account object</b>, <b>certify it's validity</b>, and if everything is fine, <b>send the user a confirmation mail</b>. This is a small piece taken out of a larger requirement, but it is enough to understand the point.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Original, smelly code</span><br />Roughly, the code has been structured as follows:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="65" src="http://goo.gl/wNjed" width="640" /></div><br /><br /><a name='more'></a>Does something attract your attention? No? Well, think about how to unit test the <code>SaveAndCertifyAccount(..)</code> method. <b>Remember the requirement</b>: first validate and persist, then certify and finally submit a confirmation mail. The diagram above shows all of the involved classes, where on the <code>AccountBl</code> side, <code>SendConfirmationMail</code> is private. This should recall your attention as this would mean that email sending is done directly there!<br /><pre class="brush:c#;highlight:[22,23]">public void SaveAndCertifyAccount(Account anAccount)<br />{<br />   //some validation logic<br />   ...<br />   certificationBl.CertifyAccount(anAccount)<br />   if(anAccount.IsSuccessfullyCertified)<br />   {<br />      //prepare from, to, subject and body<br />      ...<br />      ExecuteEmailSending(from, to, subject, body);<br />   }<br />}<br /><br />private void ExecuteEmailSending(string from, string to, string subject, string body)<br />{<br />    MailMessage mail = new MailMessage();<br />    mail.To.Add(to);<br />    mail.From = new MailAddress(from);<br />    mail.Body = body;<br />    mail.Subject = subject;<br /><br />    SmtpClient aSmtpClient = new SmtpClient(System.Configuration.ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings["SmtpAdress"]);<br />    aSmtpClient.Send(mail);<br />}</pre>This is more or less the "pseudocode" of the logic.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Objections and Comments</span><br />The highlighted lines pose the actual problem because<br /><ol><li>first of all they violate the<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1257560/when-is-a-test-not-a-unit-test/1257583#1257583">&nbsp;"rule" of what is a unit test</a>&nbsp;and what not (network access!!) and</li><li>they violate the <b>S</b>&nbsp;of the SOLID principles, namely: single responsibility&nbsp;(too much responsibility handled by the&nbsp;<code>AccountBl</code>&nbsp;class).</li></ol><div><div style="margin: 0px;">While you may still be able to automatically test your AccountBl class, it is <b>not suitable for a unit test</b>, as you would send an email each time you run your tests...<br />The more important however is point number 2:&nbsp;when thinking about a clear separation of responsibilities one immediately sees that the AccountBl's responsibility shouldn't be to send emails, but rather it should<b> request "someone else"</b> to perform that operation, i.e. an <b>EmailSender </b>or similar.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br /></div></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Proposed Refactoring</span><br />A more appropriate system would therefore look as follows:<br /><br /><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; margin: 0px; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="111" src="http://goo.gl/akIXS" style="cursor: move;" width="640" /></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><div style="margin: 0px;">You can now see that the email sending functionality&nbsp;<b>has been moved</b>&nbsp;to a separate class EMailManager (abstracted through an interface). The program logic within&nbsp;<code>AccountBl.SaveAndCertifyAccount(...)</code>&nbsp;can now be easily tested by mocking out the dependent classes.</div></div></div>
