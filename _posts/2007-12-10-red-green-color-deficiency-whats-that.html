Well, it is a special kind of color blindness and I'm actually one of those guys affected by it. Recently I thought about posting something about it for sharing my experience with others but a friend of mine - Manfred - was faster :) He wrote a very nice FAQ with a lot of information regarding this topic.<br /><br />So, before posting things redundantly, I'm linking to his post:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://manfred-ramoser.blogspot.com/2007/12/colorblindess-faq.html">http://manfred-ramoser.blogspot.com/2007/12/colorblindess-faq.html</a><br /></div><br />And I say it once again:<br /><ul><li>It is neither a disease</li><li>There is a clear difference in being color blind or having a red-green deficiency! I see colors, just a little different than the majority of people (always the majority defines which things are "right" ;) ). I'm not only seing things in black-white.<br /></li><li>We are able to drive normally, traffic lights do not pose any problem at all</li></ul>However read Manfred's post on <a href="http://manfred-ramoser.blogspot.com">his blog</a>... it answers most of the questions!
