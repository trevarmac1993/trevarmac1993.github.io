Although having quite a lot of blog readers per day, it is quite hard to make your readers interact with you. Now I've experimentally added "star-rating" which allows my readers to rate my posts, whether they were helpful or interesting or completely useless. In this way I hope to get some more feedback from my readers (so vote ;) ). Btw, thanks <a href="http://draft.blogger.com">Blogger-In-Draft</a> for this new <a href="http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-feature-reactions.html">feature</a>!<br /><br />Unfortunately I have to note that the star rating widget seems to cause some style-problems on Safari (for Windows). I'm sorry for that. I'll try to find a way to fix that as soon as possible.<br />(I should also work over the IE layout :( )
