<p>Releasing new software has to be simple and super fast! That was not the case for our company-internal class libraries till a couple of month ago until I finally decided to take the time to optimize that release process.</p>

<p>At the company where I'm working at currently, we have an internal class library which bundles a series of utilities with the scope of helping devs doing their day-to-day job. So far so good, however, there has always been a thing that &nbsp;puzzled me right from the beginning was the cumbersome release process of that library.&nbsp;Creating a release bundle consisted in</p>
<ul><li>incrementing the version number in the AssemblyInfo</li><li>building the library project in release mode</li><li>opening the bin folder</li><li>zipping the dlls</li><li>uploading the zip to our company-internal wiki page with a version history of the release</li></ul><div>That's really tedious, isn't it? <b>It sometimes took longer to create a new release than to fix a bug</b>. So a couple of months ago I decided to optimize that: <b>using NuGet</b>. If you're a .Net dev you for sure already heard about it.</div><blockquote>NuGet is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to install and update third-party libraries and tools in Visual Studio.  When you use NuGet to install a package, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project (add references, change config files, etc.). If you remove a package, NuGet reverses whatever changes it made so that no clutter is left. <br /><div><div style="text-align: right;"><a href="http://nuget.org/"><i><span style="font-size: x-small;">http://nuget.org/</span></i></a></div></div></blockquote>The idea was to create a local, company-internal NuGet repository. <br /><h2>    Setting up a company-internal NuGet Repository</h2>That turned out to be simpler than expected. Creating a local NuGet repository is as simple as creating a folder on some network share and to deploy all of your NuGet packages there. <br /><h2>    Configuring Visual Studio</h2>In order for NuGet to also search on your private repo you need to add the URL to the repository in your NuGet Package Manager Settings under <code>Tools &gt; Library Package Manager &gt; Package Manager Settings</code>.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xO0_TNrL14g/T46_Hbw4nhI/AAAAAAAADIQ/gjBpVvdqry8/s1600/nugetrepo.png" imageanchor="1" rel="zoombox" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xO0_TNrL14g/T46_Hbw4nhI/AAAAAAAADIQ/gjBpVvdqry8/s400/nugetrepo.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />When you now invoke the Nuget Package Manager on a Visual Studio Project or Solution you should also see your private repo listed as a possible source:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XgG2vdTMgy0/T47AKR1rZ2I/AAAAAAAADIY/GHfZTVs2LdA/s1600/nugetrepolisted.png" imageanchor="1" rel="zoombox" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="253" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XgG2vdTMgy0/T47AKR1rZ2I/AAAAAAAADIY/GHfZTVs2LdA/s400/nugetrepolisted.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />You're ready! You can now start packaging your class libraries and dlls as NuGet packages.<br /><h2>        Automate to the death?</h2>I'm not going to write on how to create NuGet packages as&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NuGet has excellent docs on this</a>. What I did is to create a <code>.nuspec</code> file for the class library and then a nice <code>publishRelease.bat</code> containing something like <br /><pre class="brush:bash">msbuild Siag.Base.csproj /target:Rebuild /property:Configuration=Release <br />nuget pack Siag.Base.csproj -Symbols -Prop Configuration=Release<br />move *.nupkg \\snip\snip\NuGetRepository</pre><h2>      Releasing today means...</h2><ul><li>Incrementing the version number in the AssemblyInfo.cs</li><li>double-clicking on the publishRelease.bat</li></ul><div>Like it! :)</div>
