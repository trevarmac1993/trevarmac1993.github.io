Yesterday I found some minutes to go ahead with my blog revision. Already for a longer time I<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SDnC44eBFAI/AAAAAAAABJE/todsm5dSnl0/s1600-h/labelCloudPic.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SDnC44eBFAI/AAAAAAAABJE/todsm5dSnl0/s400/labelCloudPic.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5204405126890066946" border="0" /></a> planned to integrate a label cloud, since a lot of sites and blogs which manage tags or labels have one. Instead of writing one myself, I wanted to consider the implementation of <a href="http://phydeaux3.blogspot.com/2006/09/code-for-beta-blogger-label-cloud.html">phydeaux3</a>. Till now the problem was mainly a lack of time, but also the problem that the default implementation of phydreaux3's label cloud didn't work on my blog. There were some problems with the CSS which I couldn't yet identify. Refactoring the source of my blog is also a point on my blog renewal "todo", mainly the CSS layering has to be refactored. Anyway, in the mean time I had to tweak the label cloud JavaScript a little such that it worked also for me. Now I have my own label cloud :) I have still to do some refinements but for now it works.
