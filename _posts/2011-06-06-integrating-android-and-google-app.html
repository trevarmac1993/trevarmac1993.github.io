Google App Engine is great for those of you in search of a complete, scalable&nbsp;and affordable hosting solution. Especially if you start a project and you don't yet know exactly how successful it'll be (which mostly you <b>never </b>know), how much potential users you'll have and so on, then App Engine is great. <br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mk0i6Ji_WmU/TeyQPPtvrrI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/tCuVT-qanKU/s1600/appengine_android.png" imageanchor="1" rel="zoombox" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="243" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mk0i6Ji_WmU/TeyQPPtvrrI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/tCuVT-qanKU/s320/appengine_android.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure: Demo application architecture of <a href="http://goo.gl/DvnPw">Google IO session</a></td></tr></tbody></table>It allows you to start with a free plan and then to scale your pricing as the number of users and CPU resources increases. The advantage: you don't have to setup (and pay) for a huge system to cover the maximum possible work load, but instead just pay the exact work load you need.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />So far one had to create the connection between client-side applications, whether from Android or GWT by hand (I know what I'm talking about). This means also to handle authentication issues and so on. The video below - presented at Google IO 2011 - demonstrates the creation of a task management app with an AppEngine back-end (using the<b> Google Datastore</b> as&nbsp;persistence&nbsp;medium) and an Android as well as a GWT app as the client-side front-end. It nicely demonstrates a new template which an updated version of the Google Plugin creates with<b> build-in authentication</b> and <b>Android to AppEngine RPC</b> call mechanism.<br /><br /><b>Duration:</b><br />1h<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M7SxNNC429U" width="560"></iframe>
