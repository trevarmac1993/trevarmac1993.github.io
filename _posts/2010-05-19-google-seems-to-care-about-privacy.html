I just received the following mail:<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"></span><br /><blockquote>Hi,<br />To protect your privacy we would like you to know that Google Latitude is running on your Android-powered device and reporting your location.<br />If you didn't enable this or want to stop reporting your location please open the Maps app on your device. Go to 'Menu' &gt; 'Latitude' &gt; 'Privacy' and change your privacy settings.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Google Latitude Team<br />(c) 2009 Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.&nbsp;<a href="http://m.google.com/static/tos_en-US.html" target="_blank"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black;">Terms of Service</span></a>&nbsp;|<a href="http://www.google.com/m/privacy" target="_blank"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black;">Privacy Policy</span></a></blockquote><br /><br />It seems as if Google puts more effort in giving the user best control over its privacy. I really like this kind of approach and it's really important these days, considering <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5">such statements</a> and taking into account how it is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-evolution-of-privacy-on-facebook-2010-5#-1">handled</a>.
