Google Maps has now a new feature, the "Street View".<br /><blockquote>Street View gives you navigable 360-degree street-level imagery in<br />Google Maps for selected cities. You can see images for a spot and<br />take virtual walks along that street. So when you're trying to find<br />the perfect outdoor cafe for lunch with friends or want a glimpse of<br />the neighborhood you're considering moving to, use Google Maps to see<br />what the spot actually looks like, as if you were right there in<br />person.</blockquote>The feature is really cool, although at the moment it is only available in these cities:<br />San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Las Vegas, Miami, and Denver.<br /><br />Just open <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> and navigate to one of the above cities. The there should be a button called "Street View". When you click on it, you will see a little figure appear on the map which you can move around to different locations in the city and explore the streets.<br />Here a sample of Miami I made:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/Rl_MCG_k8WI/AAAAAAAAAGU/kPnpdGcwoac/s1600-h/miami1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/Rl_MCG_k8WI/AAAAAAAAAGU/kPnpdGcwoac/s320/miami1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5070996042051547490" border="0" /></a>The appearing image in the balloon can be dragged around and zoomed in as usual on Google Maps, really as if you would stand there.<br />You can try it out, by clicking on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&amp;q=San+Francisco+Bay+Area&sll=25.737089,-80.233154&amp;sspn=0.028452,0.057335&ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.812395,-122.479287&spn=0.006238,0.014334&amp;z=17&om=1&amp;layer=c&cbll=37.81086,-122.47756&amp;cbp=1,59.8362766278136,0.481471636971951,0">this </a>link, a location on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
