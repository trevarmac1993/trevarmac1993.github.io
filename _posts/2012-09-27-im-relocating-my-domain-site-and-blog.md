About six years ago I decided to create a Blogger account and start blogging. That worked perfectly and it was a good way to start. However, now I think it's time to change.

## Changing the Domain
I will no longer continue blogging under [blog.js-development.com](http://blog.js-development.com) but rather under the domain [juristr.com](http://juristr.com). I think it's a more meaningful and representative domain name as I'm present with that acronym on a [variety](http://github.com/juristr) [of services](http://twitter.com/juristr).

Still, [blog.js-development.com](http://blog.js-development.com) will remain as it is and I will keep it for now. Too many pages link to it in order to simply cut it off. What I did however is to migrate all six years of posting from js-development to juristr.com in order to preserve them.

## Changing the Blog Engine
I'm not only going to change the domain, but mainly the blogging engine. Yep, juristr.com is no more hosted on blogger, but on [Github](http://github.com) instead powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). The guys there just do an amazing job.

It's mainly 'cause I'm a technical writer, posting lots of source code which where Blogger is not the best method after all. Moreover I wanted to have more flexibility, over the content, its license and mainly how it is published. I can hardly think of an easier and more portable way than a set of static files, right? And to top it all every single piece is source controlled.

## How to keep in touch?
Just as before, subscribe to my [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/juristrumpflohner), [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/juristr), [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Juri-Strumpflohners-TechBlog/157432560964701), [on GitHub](http://github.com/juristr) or just come by from now and then.  
Note that there are still a few things I have to fix and move into the right place.

Stay tuned for more interesting content.
