<p>Yesterday I finally concluded my studies for the Master in Computer Science at the Free University of Bolzano/Bozen. I even managed to do it with the full grade of 110 out of 110 possible credits :).</p>

I guess I<br />don't have to mention this will be my breakfast cup from<br />now on :)</td></tr></tbody></table>After concluding my Bachelor studies 3 years ago, I decided to enter the industry, working as a software developer. Still, after a year of full-time work I felt the desire to somehow "conclude" the studies by starting a Master in computer science. What I didn't want, though, was to return as a full-time student because the work in the industry does give you so much valuable experience which a pure university study is hardly able to provide you. Fortunately I had a boss which understood and supported my ambitions and so I switched to part-time work and started a MSc at the university. Obviously, being a full-time oriented study plan, and given my part-time work, my main objective was to "survive" the first exam session ;). But it turned out that I managed better than I expected and so I'm even more glad that I was able to conclude it with such an amazing result. The last 2 1/2 years were a tough time, requiring me a lot of effort, but it definitely was worth it. I can just suggest any Bachelor student to continue if he/she has the possibility to do so.<br /><br />Obviously such a result is only possible if everything works. This does not just require one's personal investment of time, but also the support from others. I need therefore to thank especially my parents which made this possible. Without their support I would not have been able to continue my studies. They always gave me the feeling to stand behind me in case something goes wrong.<br />The other person I'd like to deeply thank is my girlfriend Stefanie. I thank her for always being such a big support in any kind of situation I can imagine, not only for continuously motivating me towards the end of my studies. She's herself currently working on her MSc thesis for her degree as a MSc in Global Management and Markets-Entrepreneurship.&nbsp;I wish her all the best for her upcoming graduation :).
