<p>A couple of weeks ago I was kindly invited to join <a href="http://www.dzone.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DZone</a> as a <a href="http://www.dzone.com/aboutmvb" target="_blank">MVB (Most Valuable Blogger)</a>. If you shouldn't already know, "DZone is a technology publishing company that produces valuable content for software architects and developers worldwide."</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">The MVB program builds mutually beneficial partnerships between DZone and community bloggers whose articles are of interest to the developer community. The program simplifies the process of publishing selected blog articles by MVB members onto DZone's network of development-focused editorial websites.  Through this process, our MVBs enjoy substantially increased visibility and our audience enjoys great content. </blockquote>There are a lot of <a href="http://www.dzone.com/page/mvbs" target="_blank">amazing people participating at the DZone MVB program</a>&nbsp;wherefore&nbsp;I'm very proud to be able to contribute also a bit of my (not always really so important and interesting) stuff there. This is a huge motivation to continue trying to publishing good quality content on my blog here.<br /><br />So if you'd like to look by, here's my page ;)<br /><a href="http://www.dzone.com/users/juristr">http://www.dzone.com/users/juristr</a>
