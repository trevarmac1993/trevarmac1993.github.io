When downloading files from the web I usually have a predefined folder where all the downloads from my different browsers are stored. It doesn't take long till that folder grows to quite a <a href="http://modmyi.com/images/pauldanielash/automator-icon.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://modmyi.com/images/pauldanielash/automator-icon.png" width="200" /></a>remarkable size. Sorting out the files which are still needed is then a cumbersome and time-consuming process. Therefore,<a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2007/12/clean-up-your-folder.html"> years ago I created a Java console app</a> which takes care of removing files of a certain age.<br /><br />Since I own a <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2009/05/my-new-macbook-pro.html">Mac</a> this has become even more easy. For instance, to delete all files from a folder which haven't been accessed for 90 days and more, all you have to do is to create an automator script that executes the following unix shell command:<br /><pre class="code">find /Users/Juri/Downloads/* -type f -atime +90 -exec rm -f {} \;</pre>Note the usage of the parameter <code>-atime</code>. According to the man page<br /><pre class="code">-atime n<br />     File  was  last  accessed n*24 hours ago.  When find figures out<br />     how many 24-hour periods ago the file  was  last  accessed,  any<br />     fractional part is ignored, so to match -atime +1, a file has to<br />     have been accessed at least two days ago.<br /></pre>This parameter assures that files which you often touch (open/modify) will not be deleted from the folder. It would be somehow wrong to use <code>-mtime</code>.<br /><br />In addition after the overall cleaning process of the files you should get rid of empty folders which is done by invoking<br /><pre class="code">find /Users/Juri/Downloads/* -type d -depth -empty -exec rmdir {} \;</pre><br />Now you can combine everything in an Automator script and launch it at login time and voil√†. From now on you don't have to care any more about cleaning your downloads folder :)<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">(P.S.: For future reference you may also like to redirect log entries into a file in order to know which files have been deleted)</span>
