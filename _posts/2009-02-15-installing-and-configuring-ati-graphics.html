For the "Data Mining and Data Warehousing" course at the university, we had to implement a spectral clustering algorithm (I've already <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2008/11/c-experiences.html">written another post</a> related to it). What we had to do is basically to integrate this algorithm as a module for the XVDM system, a tool for performing high-dimensional visual data mining analysis, developed at the department of <a href="http://www.unibz.it/inf/index.html?LanguageID=en">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.unibz.it/">Free University of Bolzano</a> (main developers Andrej Taliun and Arturas Mazeika). The system is mainly written for Linux, although there exists an unofficial port for Mac OSX. However already from the beginning I experienced some problems with the XVDM system, which apparently were related to the graphics drivers on my Ubuntu Hardy system. So while performing some clustering experiments, my whole system crashed 3 times and so I finally decided to fix these annoying problems. And you know, tweaking these things is not really funny, since it happened already to me that I changed some configurations and afterward a restart of Linux I was just seeing a black screen instead of the desktop. So be really careful in changing drivers and display settings --&gt; backup your xorg.conf (/etc/X11/)!!!<br />I my case - I have a HP Compaq nx8220 business notebook - I had to update the drivers for my ATI Mobility Radeon graphics card. I'm writing this post because I found a very good wiki that describes how to install and configure the ATI drivers on your system:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide">http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide</a></div><br />The only problem you'll experience is with your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz">Compiz manager</a> (I'm a fan of <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2007/12/where-has-beryl-gone.html">Compiz</a> :) ) and OpenGL applications. In that case you will notice some flickering. The immediate solution I found is to switch off all visual effects. Comments for an alternative solution are very welcome :)
