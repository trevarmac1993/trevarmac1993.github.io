<p>Today a rather non-programming-related blog post :) . You probably encountered already the issue of configuring your Wifi access to your home or work wireless system. Usually they're behind some WPA/WPA2 encryption and the key's are usually quite long and cryptic &nbsp;(at least that's the case for my home network). On an Android phone that means weird long typing work, hoping to not miss/mistype anything.</p>

The same company has <a href="http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/">also a web application</a> as I noticed today providing a nice service that lets you bundle a number of different kind of data into a QR code. One of them is the possibility to enter your Wifi configuration. You can then use your Barcode Scanner app on your Android phone, scan the QR code and voil√°, your Wifi access has been configured. Really nice and a huge time saver!<br /><br />For this to work, you need to have the latest version of the Barcode Scanner app, which is available for free on the Android market.<br /><br />The web application generating the QR code can be found <a href="http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/">here</a>.<br /><br /><i>(As a sidenote: you can create qr codes by using Google's goo.gl shortener and appending ".qr".
