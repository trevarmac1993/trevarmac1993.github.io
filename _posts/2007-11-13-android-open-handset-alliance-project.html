There have been a lot of rumors around the web recently about an outcoming "GPhone". Actually there doesn't exist any GPhone, but Google launched a system called Android. It is an open mobile<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RzoZcachw-I/AAAAAAAAAwU/XC_BpC354MQ/s1600-h/logo_android.gif"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/RzoZcachw-I/AAAAAAAAAwU/XC_BpC354MQ/s400/logo_android.gif" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5132442701268108258" border="0" /></a> phone platform, an Open Source SDK which allows developers to build their own applications. There is a YouTube video on the <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code Page</a>, which introduces the system. The project's homepage can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/android/index.html">here</a>. I was not able to check out all the details about the project yet (I'm working now so... ;) ). However I've seen that there are detailed instructions for downloading the developer SDK and setting up the development environment (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>).<br />It will be fun to do some experiments with it, also because I gathered already some experiences and knowledge in mobile programming during the development of my bachelor thesis project. Maybe I'll write something more detailed about Android once I had the time to develop some sample application.
