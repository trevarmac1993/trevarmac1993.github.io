Consider the following .Net code:<br /><pre class="prettyprint">public static class Processor<br />{<br />        public static TItem CreateInstance&lt;TItem&gt;() where TItem:new()<br />        {<br />            TItem result = new TItem();<br />            return result;<br />        }<br />}</pre>This is a pretty straightforward class, although not so meaningless if left in this way. You may use this piece of code as follows:<br /><pre class="prettyprint">class Program<br />{<br />    static void Main(string[] args)<br />    {<br />        Test t = Processor.CreateInstance&lt;Test&gt;();<br />        Console.Write(t.SomeInt);<br />    }<br />}<br /><br />class Test<br />{<br />    public int SomeInt { get; set; }<br /><br />    public Test()<br />    {<br />        SomeInt = 3;<br />    }<br /><br />}</pre>Nothing strange so far. What I want to show however is how simple it is to create an instance of a generic type in C#.<br /><br />Now let's switch over to the Java world where I'd like to realize a similar thing. So first, create a class Processor again with a static method createInstance.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">public class Processor {<br /> public static &lt;T&gt; T createInstance(){<br />  T t = new T();<br />  return t;<br /> }<br />}</pre>Probably that's what you would write or better, would like to write since this will give you a nice compiler error. You cannot do "new T()" where T is a generic type parameter. So now the challenge starts. How can I create an instance. It turns out that you need the class for doing so s.t. it looks like<br /><pre class="prettyprint">public class Processor {<br /> public static &lt;T&gt; T createInstance(Class clazz) throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException{<br />  T t = (T) clazz.newInstance();<br />  return t;<br /> }<br />}</pre>And then you invoke it like<br /><pre class="prettyprint">public class MainClass {<br /><br /> public static void main(String[] args) throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException {<br />  Test t = Processor.createInstance(Test.class);<br />  System.out.println(t.getSomeInt());<br /> }<br />}</pre>Note in Java you don't have to pass the generic type. The compiler will understand it outmatically. That's nice. However when looking at the overall solution, the C# example seems much more elegant. If you look at the "createInstance" method in the Java example you may also note that providing the class is somehow a duplicate information. If you're a clean-code fanatic like myself the immediate thought would be to somehow get this information form the generic parameter type directly. Through reflection? It turns out that to be a major challenge. Java has a mechanism called type erasure, which eliminates generics information at runtime in order to stay backward compatible. <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html">Read this article</a> for more information.<br />Another guy which seemed to have the same problem proposed a possible workaround for this: <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=208860">happy reading</a> ;)<br /><br />Usually then, passing the class information in some acceptable way is the simpler and probably type-safer solution.
