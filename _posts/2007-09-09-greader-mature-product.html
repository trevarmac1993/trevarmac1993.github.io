<a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>, Google's News Feed Reader, has become a mature product. Some days ago the Google Reader team released a major update to their product. The product that started as a small feed reader has become the central product at Google responsible for anything related to feeds.<br />Last week they've now added the - so long requested - search functionality. Till now it was sometimes annoying. You've read something on your reader items some days ago, which you would like to see again. It was always an endless scrolling till you found what you've searched. Moreover, since Google is still a search engine, a search function was more as needed. Now they've realized it and it's great.<br /><div style="text-align: left;">See Mihai's post on the official <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com">Google Reader blog</a> for more infos:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/09/we-found-it.html">http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/09/we-found-it.html</a></div></div>
