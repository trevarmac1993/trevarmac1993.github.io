I'm using <a href="http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/">Google Browser Sync</a> already for a longer time since it is quite comfortable for synchronizing the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> bookmarks between the different computers (at work, notebook, main homepc). Today morning however I couldn't believe my eyes. When I started Firefox, the bookmarks toolbar was completely empty. The same happened also on my other PC's Firefox. Something must have gone wrong with the synchronization and so Google Browser Sync has deleted all my bookmarks.<br />Since I've seen that more people have experienced the same problem, I decided to write a post on how you can restore your deleted bookmarks (for Windows).<br /><ol><li>Open Firefox</li><li>On the menu goto Bookmarks/Organize Bookmarks<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R-gKoogjwmI/AAAAAAAABDY/mJ1LO1sn7rk/s1600-h/bookmarks.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R-gKoogjwmI/AAAAAAAABDY/mJ1LO1sn7rk/s400/bookmarks.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5181403064474780258" border="0" /></a></li><li>The Firefox Bookmark Manager will open. There on the menu click on File/Import<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R-gLI4gjwnI/AAAAAAAABDg/I3DSIe1WwzU/s1600-h/bookmarkMan.png"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R-gLI4gjwnI/AAAAAAAABDg/I3DSIe1WwzU/s400/bookmarkMan.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5181403618525561458" border="0" /></a></li><li>Proceed as shown..<br /><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R-gM8YgjwoI/AAAAAAAABEA/eBqbE6EEFPc/s400/bookmarkWiz.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5181405602800452226" style="cursor: pointer;" border="0" /><br /></li><li>Click "Next" and navigate to the folder <span style="font-style: italic;">C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;your_username&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\</span><br />If you shouldn't be able to locate the folders directly, just type it into the text-field as demonstrated below:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R-gNcogjwpI/AAAAAAAABEI/wYME8LvmWog/s1600-h/bookmarkFileDialog.png"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R-gNcogjwpI/AAAAAAAABEI/wYME8LvmWog/s400/bookmarkFileDialog.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5181406156851233426" border="0" /><br /></a>You should see a strange folder, named similar like "wu59pacm.default". Enter into that folder and then into "bookmarkbackups".</li><li>Select the most actual file and open it.<br /></li><li>You should now be able to see your bookmarks.<br /></li></ol>I hope I was able to help you. Otherwise leave a comment.
