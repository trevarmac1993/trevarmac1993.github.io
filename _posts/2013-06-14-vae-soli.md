Couple of weeks ago I got my [medium.com](http://medium.com) account activated. It is basically a blogging platform with social character. Beside being a great platform to write, it is also optimized for reading and especially collaborative writing in that it allows you to invite people to comment on your writings and as such immediately provide you with extremely valuable feedback.

The post I published on Medium is entitled "Vae Soli" and is about team work and the dynamics related to it. I dedicated special focus on the the so-called "lone wolfs", those that just don't integrate in a team and the conflicts that might arise as a consequence.

So, feel free to go to Medium and read my post:  
**[https://medium.com/on-teamwork/6d2729d40fc](https://medium.com/on-teamwork/6d2729d40fc)**

And, as usual, let me know what you think about it.
