I never really got into the Linux world. Last year I installed Suse Linux, but I used it rarely, mainly for programming C which we needed for the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course.  However I didn't get the feeling for using it...Now, since at the University workstation they installed Ubuntu, I set it up on a virtual machine, inside Windows, so just to try and see how it works. An I must say I started to like Ubuntu...I also tried out some variations of it, <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> and <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu.</a> If one is very concerned about performance, Xubuntu is the best solution, since it tries to use GTK2 applications which are quite faster.<br />The key criterias for installing Ubuntu on my Notebook were mainly a working Internet connection, especially over wireless. As I mentioned I'm not a Linux guru, I know how to navigate on Linux, but that's it. Nevertheless I wanted to get more used to it, since I find it important to know also other Operating Systems. So I searched on the net and found the <a href="http://ubuntusoftware.info/ultimate/">Ubuntu Ultimate Edition</a>. It is an edition of the Ubuntu Edgy 6.10 version with a dozen of pre-installed software such as<br /><ul><li>Subversion & build tools</li><li>Wireless Internet integration</li><li>Bluetooth integration</li><li>PPP integration</li><li>Networking tools</li><li>35 Additional fonts</li><li>Tons more themes</li><li>Repository driven Beryl</li><li>IPod support</li><li>Google Picasa</li></ul>to mention only some of them. And that's nice I think, because especially as a Windows user, it is initially difficult to get used to Linux. I installed the distro on my hard-drive and it's great. Everything works perfectly, also wireless connections.<br />What regards the visual effects, Ubuntu is in no sense behind Vista :). The Ultimate Edition has already Beryl installed which comes with nice themes and a lot of visual effects as the video below shows<br /><center><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/i9JC5NQ7G0o"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/i9JC5NQ7G0o" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object></center><br />Of course all of those visual effects can be switched off easily :D if you get irritated ;).<br />Yesterday I saw that the authors of the ultimate distribution also launched a <a href="http://ubuntusoftware.info/">Ubuntu Gamers Edition</a>.
