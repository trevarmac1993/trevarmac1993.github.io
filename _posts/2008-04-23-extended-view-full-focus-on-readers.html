I recently took a critical look at my blog and started to plan some changes. Today I'm "releasing" the first one, let's say under the theme "full focus on blog readers". The outcome is "extended view" which allows my blog readers to get the full blog-page-width for concentrating on reading the post itself.<br />You can click on the link <a onclick="fullscreenMode()" href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5211228043243414701#">extended/normal view</a> on the semi-transparent bar on the footer. This<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SA-fCPNeFLI/AAAAAAAABIk/heZoSLCMlbI/s1600-h/extendedView.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SA-fCPNeFLI/AAAAAAAABIk/heZoSLCMlbI/s400/extendedView.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192543756173055154" border="0" /></a> will start a JavaScript which lets the right and left sidebar disappear and extend the central post area. Another click on the same link restores the default view. For realizing this I used the prototype and scriptaculus JavaScript libraries.<br />It works on Firefox, IE and Safari. Safari for Windows doesn't render it so nicely, but at least it works :)
