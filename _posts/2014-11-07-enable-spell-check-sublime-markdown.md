This is a **huge lifesaver** and I don't know how I couldn't come up with this before. Check out this post to learn how you can enable spell checking when writing Markdown documents with sublime.

Since I switched to Jekyll and GitHub Pages I'm writing all of my blogs posts in Markdown. Best thing I could do! Being a developer, I spend most of my time in my text editor which happens to be Sublime Text. Given its great plugin and packages ecosystem it obviously also has one for writing Markdown: [MarkdownEditing](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/MarkdownEditing).

MarkdownEditing not only allows you to quickly navigate through the document structure (ideal for large ones)

..but it also even does in-line highlighting (even your code) while you write

But there's one thing that puzzled me: **no spell checking**. Or is there one??

**Gosh!!**

Here's how you activate it.

You basically have to open a Markdown document, then go to `Preferences > Settings - More > Syntax specific - user`. Add

```json
{
    "spell_check": true
}
```

That was easy, wasn't it? Can't believe I didn't find this before!
