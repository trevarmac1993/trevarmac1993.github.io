Yesterday morning I received a nice little box with a DZone label on it. Seems like they sent it to me as part of the [MVB program](/blog/2012/04/joining-dzone-mvb-program/) I recently joined. What a surprise! Opening the package...

...unveiled a nice letter:

  <div class="span6">
    <blockquote>
      Dear Juri,<br/><br/>

Two nice DZone Refcardz about HTML5 WebSockets and Design Patterns, a DZone mug, a developer T-Shirt, a Tizen 8GB Flash Memory, a Manning Early Access Program discount, an iPad Mini Golden Ticket (for having the chance to win an iPad mini) and last but not least, Inter-Cubicle Ballistic Missile:

The result: a hard fight against my girl

So I'd like to **thank DZone** for the very nice and kind surprise. I'm glad to be part of the MVB program and I hope I can provide some contributions this year as well.
