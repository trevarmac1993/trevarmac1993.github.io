After I first published my Google Mashup project "<a href="http://newsmapper.googlemashups.com/">News Mapper</a>", it immediately got published<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R2EqPo4W9cI/AAAAAAAAAxo/EBi1kxOUXJ4/s1600-h/gmashupdir.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/R2EqPo4W9cI/AAAAAAAAAxo/EBi1kxOUXJ4/s400/gmashupdir.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5143438697594025410" border="0" /></a> first on the <a href="http://code.google.com/gme/">Google Code site of the GME project</a> and then also on the <a href="http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/2007/10/nice-work.html">Official GME blog</a>. This clearly brought me a lot of traffic which kept on going over more weeks. The attention payed to News Mapper then decreased to an average of about 5 people / day.<br />Now, in the last 3 days, again more users started to visit News Mapper with a maximum of <span style="font-weight: bold;">324</span> users just yesterday :) . With my <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> logs I was able to see that most of the users came from the <a href="http://google-mashups.blogspot.com/">Google Mashup Directory</a> blog. I don't think this is an official Google Blog. Anyway thanks for placing my project there, whoever is the owner of the blog ;)<br />Here is the direct link to the News Mapper entry:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://google-mashups.blogspot.com/2007/11/news-mapper.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">http://google-mashups.blogspot.com/2007/11/news-mapper.html</span></a><br /></div><br />You're welcome to place your rate there :D
