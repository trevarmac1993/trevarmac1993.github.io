I recently found a JavaScript and CSS based syntax highlighting framework called <a href="http://www.dreamprojections.com/syntaxhighlighter/?ref=about">dp.SyntaxHighlighter</a>. The script works perfectly and it is really cool to have such a feature totally for free. I find it really useful, especially for people - like me - who want to publish code since with syntax highlighting it is much more readable. The problem is only that Blogger doesn't support <a href="http://www.dreamprojections.com/syntaxhighlighter/?ref=about">dp.SyntaxHighlighter</a>. Using the framework you have to put your code inside a text-area:<br />(yes I'm using my old way to post code-pieces :) )<br /><pre class="code">&lt;textarea name="code" class="java"&gt;<br />public class Test{<br />...<br />}<br />&lt;/textarea&gt;</pre>It should look something like this. So when you want to do this on your Blogger Blog, you have to switch in the Post-Editor to the "Edit HTML" part and write the code of the textarea. However then, when you switch back to "Compose" mode, the Editor will automatically replace all new-line characters inside the textarea to <span class="code">&lt;br/&gt;</span> statements which clearly results in an extremely messy looking, basically unreadable code.<br /><br />I hope this will be fixed somehow in the near future such that one can use syntax-highlighting tools here. However, what I will do (as soon as I find some free time :) ) is to use <a href="http://www.dreamprojections.com/syntaxhighlighter/?ref=about">dp.SyntaxHighlighter</a> to enhance my <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/webpublisher/index.htm">Code Notebook's Web Portal</a>.
