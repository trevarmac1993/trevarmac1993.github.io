My blog readers can now bookmark posts I've written with delicious, by just clicking on the "add to del.icio.us" link on the bottom of each post. The implementation was inspired by <a href="http://woork.blogspot.com/2007/10/blogger-hack-add-delicious-button-with.html">this blog entry</a> which I found quite neat.<br /><br />Moreover I finally managed to upload three new projects on <a href="http://projects.js-development.com/">my project page</a>, namely<br /><ul><li><a href="http://projects.js-development.com/connect4">Connect4</a> <span style="font-size:x-small;">(Artificial Intelligence)</span></li><li><a href="http://projects.js-development.com/rssowl">RSSOwl</a> <span style="font-size:x-small;">(<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform">Eclipse RCP</a>)</span></li><li><a href="http://projects.js-development.com/spectral-clustering">Spectral Clustering</a> <span style="font-size:x-small;">(Data mining, Linux, C++)</span></li></ul>Connect4 is actually an "old" project I did during my Bachelor but did never upload yet. The other two are new ones.<br />Take a look at them if you're interested.
