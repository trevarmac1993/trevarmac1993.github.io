Today, while scrolling over my <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a> entries, a headline from the <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com">Google Operating System</a> blog (not an official Google blog) got my attention: "JavaScript Google Talk".<br />Currently Google offers several options to chat:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk Client</a> (for Windows, written in C or C++)</li><li><a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk Gadget</a> (using Flash, runs on Web Browser, OS indipendent)</li><li><a href="http://www.gmail.com">Google Talk Web</a> (integrated in Gmail)</li></ul>Now, <a href="http://dev.zhourenjian.com/blog/">Zhou Renjian</a> has written a JavaScript version of the popular GTalk which is worth for a post. Apparently it has been written in Java by using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">Eclipse SWT</a> UI components and Smack (a library for <a href="http://www.jabber.org/" target="_blank">Jabber's XMPP</a>). Afterwards it has been converted to JavaScript using <a href="http://java2script.org/">Java2Script</a>. It is really worth to visit and test the client. It almost looks as the real Gtalk desktop client.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://demo.java2script.org/gtalk/">Google Talk JavaScript Client</a><br /></div><br />It is interesting to see how Java and even SWT user interfaces can be converted to JavaScript. I've never tested it personally...it sounds fantastically however. The JavaScript client of GTalk communicates using Servlets (as I understood).<br /><br />Another nice implementation of online messengers is <a href="http://www.meebo.com">Meebo</a>. It is a page, where you can login and use GTalk, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and AIM. From a developer point of view it is interesting to see the capabilities of webpages...also because Meebo doesn't use Flash (also if it is hardly believable by looking at the UI) but it uses AJAX.
