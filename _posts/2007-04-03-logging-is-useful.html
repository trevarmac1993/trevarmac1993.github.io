When I develop some application, I usually add a logging functionality to it. I find logging useful, especially for maintaining the application.<br />Some bugs cannot be caught with tests and you often neither detect them when using the application. But then, once you release it and a user runs your application, at some point he will for sure get a stacktrace as usual :). A log-file, which keeps track of the latest events and/or failures, is then extremely useful to quickly detect the problem. Initially I started to use <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">log4j</a>, which is a very nice library with a huge amount of functionalities (I didn't for sure find all of them :D ). However I then started to develop my own logger, since I think that if you have your home-made projects, you don't really want to write complicated configuration-files and that stuff. Just load the library and start logging...<br />So I developed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplelog/">SimpleLog</a>. As the name says, it is a very basic, simple logging utility for Java. My decision was to write all log-entries to an XML file, for which reason <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplelog/">SimpleLog</a> also needs to have the JDom library in the build-path of your project. I've chosen that, because this guarantees flexibility. In this way one could also write its own application that does some analysis stuff upon the created xml-log-files, which could be interesting (i.e. failure distribution over classes; failure frequency, etc...).<br /><br />I've uploaded everything to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplelog/">this </a>location. Before installing please read the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplelog/wiki/LogUsage">Wiki </a>pages, where I gave an example of how to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplelog/">SimpleLog</a>. If you then decide to use it, it would be nice if you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplelog/issues/list">report issues</a> to me such that I can improve it. <a href="http://juri.strumpflohner.googlepages.com/samplelogfile.zip">Here </a>you can find also a sample-log file.
