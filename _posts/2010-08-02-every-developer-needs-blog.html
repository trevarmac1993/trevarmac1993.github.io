<p>I just watched an interesting talk from Channel 9 held by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman</a>.&nbsp;His message: "<b>Every developer needs a blog</b>". As you can imagine it is a rather non-technical talk, but still interesting cause he emphasizes the importance of being "socially" active the "geek way" ;)
</p>

If you have already a blog or you're an active Twitter or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">SO</a> user it might be less interesting since you're already on the "right path".<br /><br />Hanselman wrote an according <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/745570/how-can-social-networking-sites-make-you-a-better-developer">SO post</a> the day before the talk and a guy answering the post about why social networking might make you a better developer, wrote a very good answer:<br /><br /><blockquote>But seriously, I think the biggest thing it does is remind people what a good developer can be. If you are someone who enjoys to go for a jog 2-3 times a week, you could very easily be the best runner you know. You might think that what you do is at or near the limit of what anyone could expect to do.<br /><br />Until you go to a 5k filled with other serious runners. Then you realize where you stand.</blockquote><u><b>Here are the vids:</b></u><br /><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Glucose/Hanselminutes-on-9-Social-Networking-for-Developers-Part-1-Every-Developer-Needs-a-Blog/">Video Channel 9 Part I</a><br /><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Glucose/Hanselminutes-on-9-Social-Networking-for-Developers-Part-2-Make-your-Blog-Suck-Less/">Video Channel 9 Part II</a> (haven't seen that yet)
