<p>A couple of days ago I got the order to write a very simple program that would take a bunch of XML input files with the task to elaborate them in terms of grouping them according to some identifier and then to output the result (grouped per directory) in a more user friendly and readable way. While the prog is stupidly simple there are still some potential pitfall one might not realize immediately.<br /><div>
</p>

</div><div>The objective was to give the tool to one of our customers in order to facilitate their work, hence:&nbsp;<b>pay attention to usability factors</b>.<br />I started with a simple GUI:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UVpFTtFtcwc/TsY_ppK3DqI/AAAAAAAAC6k/C8WWMOXItwg/s1600/avcpGui.png" imageanchor="1" rel="zoombox" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UVpFTtFtcwc/TsY_ppK3DqI/AAAAAAAAC6k/C8WWMOXItwg/s400/avcpGui.png" width="400" /></a></div><div>So far, nothing special. There is a source folder textbox and a destination folder. They're self-explanatory I guess. What the program should do (for comfortability reasons) is to <b>create the destination folder</b> if it doesn't exist and if it exists already, <b>delete all its content</b>, as it might originate from a previous elaboration.<br /><br />A naive approach would be to do<br /><pre class="brush:c#">if(!Directory.Exists(destinationDir))<br />{<br />   Directory.CreateDirectory(destinationDir);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />   //delete all files and directories in destinationDir<br />}<br /></pre>But attention! What might a "dummy" user do what an "expert" user might not? Probably enter something like this:<br /><i>Source: C:\sourceFileDirectory</i><br /><i>Destination:&nbsp;C:\sourceFileDirectory</i><br /><b>Bad:</b> You delete all of the source files.<br /><br />Or even worse:<br /><i>Source: C:\sourceFileDirectory</i><br /><i>Destination:&nbsp;C:\</i><br /><b>Bad:</b>&nbsp;You wipe his C drive :D.<br /><br />These are exactly the problems that are often overlooked (as they might seem obvious) and which then cause&nbsp;enormous&nbsp;damage.&nbsp;Therefore a possible solution might be..<br /><pre class="brush:c#">if(!Directory.Exists(destinationDir))<br />{<br />   Directory.CreateDirectory(destinationDir);<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />   //create an output directory inside the specified <br />   destinationDir = Path.Combine(destinationDir, "Out");<br /><br />   if(!Directory.Exists(destinationDir))<br />   {<br />      //create it<br />   }<br />   else<br />   {<br />      //Ask the user about wiping the content of the output directory<br />      //Do it if confirmed<br />   }<br />}<br /></pre></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UPzkbtJyeyw/TsZEkSsCsBI/AAAAAAAAC6s/wikSP-jhl3s/s1600/avcpConfirmation.png" imageanchor="1" rel="zoombox" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="207" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UPzkbtJyeyw/TsZEkSsCsBI/AAAAAAAAC6s/wikSP-jhl3s/s400/avcpConfirmation.png" width="400" /></a></div>Have a nice weekend :).
