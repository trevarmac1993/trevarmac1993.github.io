My recent <a href="http://juri-strumpflohner.blogspot.com/2007/10/now-in-two-weeks-after-my-successful.html">News Mapper mashup</a> seems to have some success (at least for me :) ). Today I registered 114 visits which is my personal record for 1 day :D . Over 300 users have visited the project in the 6 days since when it is online now.<br />Moreover <a href="http://newsmapper.googlemashups.com/">News Mapper</a> has been listed together with other two projects on the official Google Mashup Editor Blog (below there is the link to the post).<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:130%;"><a href="http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/2007/10/nice-work.html">http://googlemashupeditor.blogspot.com/2007/10/nice-work.html</a></span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br />Thanks for this feedback!<br /></div></div>
