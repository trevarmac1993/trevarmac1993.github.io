When I create a new piece of software I usually also want to give them the appropriate look (from a style perspective). That's in my eyes also a main key point to make it successful and user-friendly.<br />Icons play a major role. What you have to pay attention to is to have clear and unified set of icons throughout the whole UI. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is a nice sample for that.<br />Finding the appropriate icons is however not always that easy. But I found two search engines which may help you:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.iconlet.com/">Iconlet.com<br /></a>You find there a rich set of different icons structured. There are a lot of the icons which are used on the Eclipse UI. They are simple but still nice-looking and clearly understandable. <a href="http://www.iconlet.com/search?n=save">Here</a> is a sample of searching for the keyword "save".</li><li><a href="http://www.iconlook.com/">ICONLook.com</a><br />Another search engine I found today is ICONLook. Icons there are more Microsoft style. There are a lot of Windows Vista glass style icons.<br /><a href="http://www.iconlook.com/search.icon?q=save&amp;s12=on&amp;s16=on&amp;s22=on&amp;s32=on&amp;s48=on&amp;s64=on&amp;s128=on">Here</a> is a sample of searching for the keyword "save".</li></ul>
