I always liked the idea of having a office-like suite on the web. I already used Writely for taking quick notes or just short documents, already before it was acquired by Google and merged - together with Google Spreadsheets - to the <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Documents service</a>. But still most commonly at the end I used my local office suite (MS Office normally).<br /><br />But since the switch to my new MacBook Pro notebook (I really like it ;) ) I started to use GDocs really heavy. I didn't install MS Office (for Mac) but <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a>. GDocs comes in very handy. Ok, I admit, as a software developer you don't write much documents (normally) but for my master studies there is plenty to write. So for documents that have to be written more formally (<a href="http://projects.js-development.com/lifepin/LifePinReport.pdf?attredirects=0">architectural documents</a>, <a href="http://projects.js-development.com/papers/SpectralClustering.pdf?attredirects=0">reports</a>, ...) I started to use LaTeX (together with the <a href="http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/">Texclipse plugin</a>), which is really great once you're comfortable with it's syntax. For the remaining, GDocs is just perfect. It opens quickly, extremely responsive, <a href="http://gears.google.com/">even offline support</a> and you're not bound to it which is of major importance. You can export the end result in a plenty of formats<br /><div class="separator screenshots" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SrZa9tVT0nI/AAAAAAAACcg/je3QhbvpXPs/s1600-h/GDocsExportFormats.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SrZa9tVT0nI/AAAAAAAACcg/je3QhbvpXPs/s320/GDocsExportFormats.png" /></a><br /></div><br />Other nice features are revisions of your file and the nearly (real-time) collaboration on the same document (nice for writing documents in parallel with others).<br />The only problem I had till now is when it comes to write notes for some scientific stuff where you have a lot of formulas, what then. Well this was one reason for using LaTeX instead of MS Office or OpenOffice. But GDocs?? Today I came across this when making some notes in preparation for my Statistic exam and look there, GDocs has now (I guess since a couple of days) a new equation editor that supports <b>LaTeX</b> syntax!!<br /><div class="separator screenshots" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SrZcnnvqdQI/AAAAAAAACco/gh1yIwd3bug/s1600-h/GDocsEquationEditor.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SrZcnnvqdQI/AAAAAAAACco/gh1yIwd3bug/s320/GDocsEquationEditor.png" /></a><br /></div>While you write the LaTeX syntax on top, it will simultaneously write you the end result in the preview below. Really cool :)
