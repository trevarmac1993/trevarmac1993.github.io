There exist some interesting advent calendars around the web which may be interesting for some of you. For instance the website "<a href="http://entwickler-press.de/">entwickler-press.de</a>" offers a nice one, where you get each day a free developer eBook. There are nice ones such as "The Google Web Toolkit", "Visual C#", "Java 6" and so on. Unfortunately (for all my English-speaking blog readers) these eBooks are all written in German.<br /><a href="http://www.chip.de">Chip.de</a> has also an <a href="http://www.chip.de/artikel/Download-Adventskalender_12827094.html">advent calendar</a> offering each day nice full-version tools for free. Today "BoostSpeed" can be downloaded.<br /><br />If anyone of you knows other calendars, please put a comment with a link here :) .
