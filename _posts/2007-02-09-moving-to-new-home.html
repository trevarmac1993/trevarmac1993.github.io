The step is done... :)

After <a dragover="true" href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger </a>left its beta phase, I entertained the idea of moving <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85">my current webpage</a> hosted at lycos to a blogger account. This came me in mind also because for half a year now I mainly use <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85">my page</a> as a blog. The problem is that the page is completely static with the exception of some JavaScript which runs on it. "Posting" means manually editing the HTML code and for letting readers subscribe to it, I wrote a little Java application, that creates a rss-file out of my posts by parsing HTML code. All in all a fairly complicated process. But on the other side you are very flexible since you can add pages and remove them as you like...

Therefore - also because I finally got some free days after finishing the exams at the university - I started to move the layout of my (old) <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85">my page</a> to my new created Blogger-account and I must say that I managed quite well. Clearly there are still some delicacies which I will have to change, but I'm quite satisfied with the appearence of the blog and also with the functionalities of Blogger.

To not completely give up my old page, this blog here is tightly linked with it...So for instance I still have the <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/downloads.htm">download section</a>, or the <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/myprogs.htm">"my progs" section</a> and of course <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/projects.htm">my projects</a> there. I also put all the old posts in some kind of archive which you find <a href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/kito85/archives/archive_last.htm">here</a>.
