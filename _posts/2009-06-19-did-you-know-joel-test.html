Joel Spolsky is a software developer in the US. I came across <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">his interesting blog</a> about a year ago. He started his working career at Microsoft and left it in 2000, founding (together with Michael Pryor) his own company: <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a> (take a look at the pictures there...this is what I call a nice working environment :) ).<br />One of my favourite quotes from him:<br /><blockquote>[...]We didn't start with a particular product in mind: our goal was simply to build the kind of software company where we would want to work, one in which programmers and software developers are the stars and everything else serves only to make them productive and happy.[...]</blockquote>He is the one of the creators of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow.com</a> which in my opinion is one of the best developer sites available on the net. The idea of letting developers vote is amazing since in this way the system corrects and balances itself (the same concept as behind Wikipedia). People just writing bad stuff will just get voted down or even removed. The next site <a href="http://serverfault.com/">Serverfault.com</a> is also in beta which is most for system admins.<br /><br />But let's return to the topic. What is the "Joel Test"?<br /><blockquote>[...]It's a fairly esoteric system for measuring how good a software team is.[...]&nbsp; The great part about it is that it takes about 3 minutes.[...]</blockquote><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Here</a> you find a more detailed description and here are the questions:<br /><b>The Joel Test</b><br /><ol><li>Do you use source control?</li><li>Can you make a build in one step?</li><li>Do you make daily builds?</li><li>Do you have a bug database?</li><li>Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</li><li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li><li>Do you have a spec?</li><li>Do programmers have quiet working conditions?</li><li>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</li><li>Do you have testers?</li><li>Do new candidates write code during their interview?</li><li>Do you do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallway_usability_testing#Hallway_testing">hallway usability testing</a>?<br /></li></ol>
