<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Note that this blog post is obsolete as I switched both, my blog hosting provider as well as the syntax highlighting tool.</p>

This was actually a point which was somehow a <a href="http://juri-strumpflohner.blogspot.com/2007/04/syntax-highlighting-on-blogger_20.html">thorn in my side</a>. I wasn't far from writing my own syntax highlighting javascript... Today however I found one that works great. It is simple, adaptable and easily configurable.<br />The used strategy is the one that is most commonly used by web-based syntax highlighting tools. It basically consists of two components: a CSS and a JavaScript file. The CSS file defines the different tag-colors that will be used for highlighting. The src-code that is published on some HTML page is usually placed inside a pre or code container. This container is then parsed by the JavaScript file which assigns the CSS class declarations to the correct keywords, having the effect of highlighting them.<br /><br />But now some more details to the tool itself that I've found. It is called "google-code-prettify" and can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/">here</a>. For more details about the configuration stuff and how it can be implemented on your own website just refer to the <a href="http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html">README.html</a> page on the project site, which explains clearly all the necessary steps that have to be taken.<br /><br />Here are some examples how it looks like (also <a href="http://juri-strumpflohner.blogspot.com/2007/12/unknown-protocol-d.html">here</a>):<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">My old code formatting style:</span><br /><pre class="code">public class MyTest{<br />private String myString;<br /><br />public MyTest(){<br /> this.myString = "Hello World!";<br />}<br /><br />public void printMessage(){<br /> System.out.println(myString);<br />}<br /><br />public static void main(String[] args){<br /> MyTest t = new MyTest();<br /> t.printMessage();<br />}<br />}<br /></pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">New google-code-prettify style:</span><br /><pre class="prettyprint">public class MyTest{<br />private String myString;<br /><br />public MyTest(){<br /> this.myString = "Hello World!";<br />}<br /><br />public void printMessage(){<br /> System.out.println(myString);<br />}<br /><br />public static void main(String[] args){<br /> MyTest t = new MyTest();<br /> t.printMessage();<br />}<br />}<br /></pre>The colouring works perfectly. I also modified the highlighting script a little such that I was able to keep my way of highlighting things in the code:<br /><pre class="prettyprint">...<br />System.out.println(<b>myString</b>);<br /></pre>That was quite easy since I just needed to add some lines to the CSS file.<br />What I've still to optimize is the loading of the JavaScript files. I'll see whether I can do that in an asynchronous mode because otherwise it starts to slow down the loading of my blog as the number of scripts increases.<br />If you have problems in configuring the google-code-prettify script on your own blog, just drop me a line.
