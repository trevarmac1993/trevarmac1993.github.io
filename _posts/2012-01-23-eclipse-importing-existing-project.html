<p>Monday morning, 07:30 AM. Me, starting the computer after the weekend, executing a <code>git pull</code> from <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2010/11/juri-goes-git-first-steps.html" target="_blank">my repository</a>&nbsp;to fetch the latest src. Then I opened my freshly installed Eclipse JavaScript version followed by a nice "Import existing project" (I pushed the project on my Mac previously) on the just fetched git repository. Fail.</p>

<blockquote>Invalid project description </blockquote>

Damn. My first thought was a potential incompatibility, given that the project was created on my Mac previously, and I just tried to import it on Win7.<br />So if you should encounter a similar problem try the following. Assume you pulled the repository into <code>C:\gitrepo\mygit</code>. Then<br /><br /><ul><li>create another directory, for instance <code>C:\eclipsewrkspc\mygit</code></li><li>start Eclipse to use that directory as its workspace.</li><li>use the "Import existing project" functionality and point to the git directory</li><li>Uncheck the "copy into workspace" flag.</li></ul>
<div>That approach should work, at least it did for me.</div>
