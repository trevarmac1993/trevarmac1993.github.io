Some time ago, I wrote a <a href="http://juri-strumpflohner.blogspot.com/2007/03/diving-into-new-area.html">post</a> regarding Ubuntu where I also mentioned about the nice visual effects produced by the <a href="http://beryl-project.org/">Beryl window manager</a>. The effects are actually great and they can compete without any problems with Vista. What I have to complain about anyway is that it occasionally happens that the whole system freezes and then you have only the chance of shutting the system down by removing its energy cable. :) Therefore you should consider not to use the manager when you are doing serious work, however the guys of the <a href="http://beryl-project.org/">Beryl project</a> are improving the product constantly.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">My system:</span><br />    HP Compaq nx8220<br />    Intel(R) Centrino Pentium(R) M, 2,13 GHz<br />    1 GB RAM<br />Some interesting links:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/distros.php">http://www.beryl-project.org/distros.php</a></li><li><a href="http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu">http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu</a><br /></li></ul>
