Here's an article written by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pietrobr/">Pietro Brambati</a> on his blog about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pietrobr/archive/2009/02/05/internet-explorer-8-sulla-compatibilit.aspx">IE8 compatibility</a>. It's quite interesting to go quickly over it, especially for web developers. The original blog post is in Italian, here's the automatic translation into English: <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?prev=hp&amp;hl=en&amp;js=n&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.msdn.com%2Fpietrobr%2Farchive%2F2009%2F02%2F05%2Finternet-explorer-8-sulla-compatibilit.aspx&amp;sl=it&amp;tl=en">* translated version *</a> (thanks to <a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google</a>).
