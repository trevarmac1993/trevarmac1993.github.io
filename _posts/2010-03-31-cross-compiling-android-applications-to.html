<b>Comment</b><br />Nice talk that gives insight in an approach for cross-compiling Android targeted apps to the iPhone (but not only). The idea is to overcome the problem of coding the mobile app for multiple platforms which often is just not feasible due to time and skills.<br />A thing which I find rather interesting is their decision to use XSL stylesheet transformations for doing the code generation stuff which is a somewhat alternative, but on the other side quite reasonable approach. They claim that it is not needed to tweak your - say - Android app in a special mode in order to be cross-compiled. It would be interesting to try that out, maybe I'll find some free time (which is improbable, but still...). On device specific features like Bluetooth operations etc. it certainly won't work I guess.<br /><br /><b>Duration</b><br />1h 9m<br /><br /><object height="385" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TG-NIt2O5J8&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/TG-NIt2O5J8&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>
