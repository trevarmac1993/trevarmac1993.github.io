Some weeks ago I launched <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth </a>to check out a route. For some reason however the globe didn't appear inside the application. All of the pointers, flags and country borders however where there, just the main earth surface was missing. I didn't get the point and didn't also have the time to search for it. I removed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google Earth and re-installed it...with no success. Since at that time I didn't had the patience and time to go in search for the reason I just opened Google Maps and got the needed information there.<br />Yesterday I casually opened <a href="http://manfred-ramoser.blogspot.com/">Manfred's blog</a> and flew over some of his posts. And then I found <a href="http://manfred-ramoser.blogspot.com/2008/06/problems-with-google-earth.html">this one</a>. I remembered to have it seen there, but I didn't remember the exact content. Manfred describes a similar problem and actually it was the same in my case. Changing the "graphics mode" inside the Google Earth options to DirectX solved the problem.<br />Check out Manfred's post for further details: <a href="http://manfred-ramoser.blogspot.com/2008/06/problems-with-google-earth.html">http://manfred-ramoser.blogspot.com/2008/06/problems-with-google-earth.html</a>
