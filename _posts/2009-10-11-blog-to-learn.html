John Skeet answered a question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1548442/i-know-how-to-program-now-how-do-i-learn-to-design/1548457#1548457">SO</a> related to how to learn good programming in terms of learning good software design.<br />I liked John's statement which btw explains pretty much why to have a technical blog <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/">like this one here</a>. <br /><blockquote>[...]Write. Blog about what you've done and how well it's worked. This goes beyond looking carefully - just working out how to <i>express</i> your successes and failures will make them clearer in your own mind. Be warned: writing can be addictive and time-consuming.[...]<br /></blockquote>Actually this is a pretty good known concept: learn by reflecting about it (remember <a href="http://www.retrospectives.com/">retrospectives</a> in agile development ;) ). And that's what you do when you explain things to others (like when you blog about a topic). For doing so you really have to have a deep understanding, unless you're just pointing out things of course.
