<b>Comment</b><br />This is an extremely useful addon to jQuery: templates. The video below shows you a preview of the templating mechanism which will be contributed by MS to jQuery. It allows you to define HTML template structures which will then be fed through jQuery with JSON data from Ajax calls. Similar stuff has already been presented in several ASP.net 4 video talks. Microsoft is putting huge effort into integrating, supporting (and extending) jQuery which I really appreciate (as well as their move to best practices like unit testing, MVC, etc.)<br />If things go on this way, jQuery and HTML5 will be the prevalent technologies on the web. Such moves contribute a lot to make the web a better experience.<br /><br /><b>Duration</b><br />4 m<br /><br /><object height="385" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nRv4dJrpBuY&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nRv4dJrpBuY&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>
