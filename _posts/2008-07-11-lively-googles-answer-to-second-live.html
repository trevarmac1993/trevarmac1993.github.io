Originally I wanted to finish a post I'm currently writing, but then I came across one mentioning Google's newest product. There have already been some rumors about a secret project at Google and now it's out. <a href="http://www.lively.com/">Lively</a> is the newest addition to the<a href="http://labs.google.com/"> Google Labs</a> directory, a new way of <a href="http://www.lively.com/images/corner_logo.gif" imageanchor="1" style="border: 0pt none ; background-color: transparent; clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; float: right; margin-left: 1em;"><img src="http://www.lively.com/images/corner_logo.gif" style="border: 0pt none ;" /></a>communicating with people in 3D. <span class="byline-author"><a href="http://niniane.org/">Niniane Wang</a>, Engineering Manager at Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/be-who-you-want-on-web-pages-you-visit.html">told </a>that she started it as 20% project. Impressive what comes out of these experimental projects.</span><span class="byline-author">I just started to create a room to test Lively: </span><a href="http://www.lively.com/dr?rid=-6320493790308243766">My little island</a> :) Nice is that it directly integrates into the browser.
