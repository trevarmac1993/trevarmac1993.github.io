I'm currently developing some custom ASP.net server controls. Internally I often have lists, where the user (programmer) can specify a variable number of sub-controls which are consumed/managed by the parent custom server control:<br /><pre class="prettyprint">public List&lt;SomeControl&gt; SomeControls<br />{<br />  get<br />  {<br />    ...<br />  }<br /><br />  set<br />  {<br />    ...<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br />This kind of list is used for controls where the user (programmer) specifies something like<br /><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;mySrvCtrls:MyServerControl id="mySrvControl1" runat="server" ...&gt;<br />  &lt;mySrvCtrls:SomeControl id="...1" runat="server" ... &gt;<br />  &lt;mySrvCtrls:SomeControl id="...2" runat="server" ... &gt;<br />  &lt;mySrvCtrls:SomeControl id="...3" runat="server" ... &gt;<br />&lt;/mySrvCtrls&gt;<br /></pre><br />They're already working, but now I'd like to add some VS designer support, since when switching to Design-View my controls throw the error<br /><blockquote>'SomeControl' could not be set on property 'SomeControls'</blockquote>Apparently the problem is that collections of controls such as my "SomeControls" (dummy) property here, have to be specified as readonly, meaning to change them to something like<br /><pre class="prettyprint">public List&lt;SomeControl&gt; SomeControls<br />{<br />  get<br />  {<br />    ...<br />  }<br /><br />}<br /></pre><br />But still, in such a case you have to pay attention to ensure in your get that you're properly instantiating the collection you're returning if it's null.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">public List&lt;SomeControl&gt; SomeControls<br />{<br />  get<br />  {<br />    if(_SomeControls == null)<br />      _SomeControls = new List&lt;SomeControl&gt;();<br />    <br />    return _SomeControls;<br />  }<br /><br />}<br /></pre><br />This solved my design-time error.
