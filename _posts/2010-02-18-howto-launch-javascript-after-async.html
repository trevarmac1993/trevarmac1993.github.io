Assume the scenario where you want to launch a JavaScript function after your UpdatePanel finished to do its async postback. This turns out to actually be quite simple. What you do is to use the <code>ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(...)</code> method.<br /><pre class="prettyprint">ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(btnSave, this.GetType(), "myScriptKey", "myFunction()", true);<br /></pre>The only thing I found that people misdo is to not specify the correct instance&nbsp;(1st parameter)&nbsp;that caused the asynchronous postback to fire and thus the UpdatePanel to do the postback. In such a case it will just fail silently.
