I came across jQuery on the web already several times, but I never took a deep look at it. Now some days ago, &nbsp;Scott Guthrie posted some steps on his blog that show you how to add Intellisense support jo jQuery inside Visual Studio (and also the Express Editions). So take a look at it, it's quite interesting...<br /><ul><li><span style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; color: #551a8b; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/21/jquery-intellisense-in-vs-2008.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/21/jquery-intellisense-in-vs-2008.aspx</a></span><br /></li></ul>That was the outcome of my try, in just 3 minute it was working:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SS_g4XQMa1I/AAAAAAAABpY/hjF5EWc7snE/s1600-h/JQueryIntellisense.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/SS_g4XQMa1I/AAAAAAAABpY/hjF5EWc7snE/s320/JQueryIntellisense.jpg" /></a></div>Here's a related link to Peter's blog where he points out "<a href="http://peitor.blogspot.com/2008/11/how-to-set-focus-to-username-textbox-of.html">how to set the focus to the username textbox of asp:LoginView</a>&nbsp;".
