First of all: I forgot my blog's "birthday" :D On the 9th february this blog here became 1 year old. My resum√© of 1 year of blogging?? Well, mostly what's written already <a href="http://juri-strumpflohner.blogspot.com/2008/01/roundup-of-blogging-year-2007.html">here</a>. There would be so many interesting things to write about but I'm really occupied at the moment. Time is short, unfortunately :). But I'll for sure try to cover some of the topics I mentioned at the end of this<a href="http://juri-strumpflohner.blogspot.com/2008/01/roundup-of-blogging-year-2007.html"> post</a>.<div>But now to the topic of this one. I just had to help my brother opening a .docx file and thought some of you may be interested in it. Docx is the new format produced by Microsoft Word 2007. More info's can be found <a href="http://www.fileinfo.net/extension/docx">here</a> (I don't want to be redundand ;) ). So if you're using an MS Office product that is older than 2007, e.g. 2003 or 2002 you may be interested in installing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en">FileFormatConverter</a> offered on the Microsoft Update site. Just download and install it and you will be able to open docx files with your old MS Word.</div>
