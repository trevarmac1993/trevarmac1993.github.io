Since the launch of the iPhone and later the Android mobile OS, Google has investigated some time in creating more mobile friendly interfaces of their common web applications (<a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://reader.google.com/">GReader</a>, <a href="http://docs.google.com/">GDocs</a>,<a href="http://wave.google.com/">Wave</a>), optimized for the advanced touch interfaces. Given the buzz about the launch of the iPad recently, it is no surprise that they have optimized their web interface to nicely fit the larger iPad touch screen.<br /><div><br /></div><div>You can actually look at the live interface by using your <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome </a>browser.</div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S8H2tx67bQI/AAAAAAAACjU/r_EtHRnU0Ic/s1600/GmailIpad.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="402" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tF6XjsUy87k/S8H2tx67bQI/AAAAAAAACjU/r_EtHRnU0Ic/s640/GmailIpad.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><div>If you experience any problems try to restart Chrome or delete all of the cookies.
