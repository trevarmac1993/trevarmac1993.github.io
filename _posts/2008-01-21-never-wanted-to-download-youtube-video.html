YouTube has become an enourmous platform of video information. You find everything from technical tutorials and speechs, music clips to nonsense stuff put by someone. I guess it happened also to you that you wanted to download a video to your computer for maybe viewing it offline at a later point. Recently Marco - a working collegue of mine - had the same problem and he also found an appropriate service which does it for you. There are a bunch of it, but this one seems quite nice. You have just to go to <a href="http://keepvid.com/">http://keepvid.com/</a>. There you have to enter the URL of the desired YouTube-video or you can also drop the "keep it" button to your toolbar, so it does it for you. The direct download link will then be provided to you. For playing the file you'll need a Flash Video Player which you get <a href="http://applian.com/flvplayer?src=KeepvidPlay">here</a>.
