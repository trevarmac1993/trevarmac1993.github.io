<p>Today I took the chance (and a bit of free time) to upgrade to the latest Android SDK release, namely Gingerbread. Experience has shown that you better back up your Eclipse as well as currently installed Android SDK folder, especially if you're working on an important project (which I consider my Master thesis project to be kind of ;)).</p>

Apparently for some reason OSX added the .DS_Store folder (which is a hidden one) to the platforms folder of the Android SDK. A quick <code>rm -rf .DS_Store</code> fixed the issue.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The next problem I encountered was the following message which hindered my project to build correctly:<br /><pre>Conversion to Dalvik format failed: Unable to execute dex: null</pre>Apparently the problem was related to the fact that my Android project referenced another Java project containing shared classes. Removing and re-attaching the reference didn't solve the problem. Neither did a clean in Eclipse.<br />Fortunately Xav, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> user and Android SDK Tech Lead at Google Inc posted that they released &nbsp;a new version 8.0.1 of the Android Eclipse ADT, specifically for fix this issue. So by simply updating to the new plugin solved the issue.
