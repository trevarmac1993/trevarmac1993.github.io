Those of you (as myself) who were not able to attend the Eclipse Conference at Santa Clara have the possibility to download most of the material from the conference website:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/"><span style="font-size:130%;">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/</span></a><br /></div><br />The same holds for the last years (<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2007/">2007</a>, <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/">2006</a>,...). There should be some interesting tutorials and talks available for download in the next days.<br />I'll see whether I'm able to manage to attend the conference once :(
