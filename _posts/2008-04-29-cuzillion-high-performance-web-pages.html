I don't want to write much (I'm too lazy today :) ), but I just flew over my GReader feeds and disovered the following interesting post. It describes an open source tool written by Steve Souders, member of the performance group at Google, which lets you create combinations of webpages in terms of their components (CSS, images, iframes, scripts, etc...) and test them for their performance (on different browsers).<br /><br />Here's his blog post:  <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/04/25/cuzillion/">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/04/25/cuzillion/</a><br />...and here  the tool itself:  <a href="http://stevesouders.com/cuzillion/">http://stevesouders.com/cuzillion/ </a>
