After quite a long time of silence, today the were a lot of rumors regarding <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a>. After adding an initial loading page, they released a <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/about_whatsnew.html">"labs" tab</a> today, which is available in Gmail's settings page. Users can activate and try out new features for their Gmail account there and give<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/gmailevolve.png"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/gmailevolve.png" alt="" border="0" /></a> immediate feedback. I find it an interesting way of developing new features in an agile fashion by getting continuous feedback from users which is the key success factor. It's nice because with those "labs" features, the Gmail team can at any time just release a new feature, let the users try them out and see how they react to them. If it is a success, development will go on and otherwise it will just be taken away. Things can be released in a very informal fashion without any commitment.<br />Here is a related techcrunch article which shows also screenshots of Gmail's evolution.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(</span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/introducing-gmail-labs.html">Link</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> to the Official Gmail Blog post)</span></span>
