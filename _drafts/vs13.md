Scott Hanselman's talk about the new in ASP.net and VS2013. Every .Net web-dev should have a look it as you [should know the tools you have at hand](/blog/2012/08/know-your-tools-become-javascript-power/).

## My personal highlights

**VS Smart Search with VS Gallery Results**  
<kbd>Crtl</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>: Activates the usual VS smart search (I love so much in [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) but now it also includes results from the VS gallery.


- Crtl+,: internal search (img)
- Easy extensible Project templates
- Default Bootstrap as the theme (huge win)
- scaffolding as NuGet packages
- Model first DB migrations now also support using stored procedures rather than just describing it through C# code
- multiple browser refresh (hanselman doing some crazy stuff of tunneling through Browserstack and SignalR)
- images preview in CSS + direct base64 conversion....cool
