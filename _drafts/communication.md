I'm sure I did already mention that I work in the eGovernment sector and as such mainly for the public administration. Recently our company started the process of merging with another company or better with a couple of other IT departments that previously were (are) part of the public administration. That said, we're currently living a tough process of cultural shift...

What do I mean with that: I mean the kind of difficulties and problems that arise when two realities hit each other, when two different companies and their people all of a sudden need to become one. It is interesting to see how the top managers define projects, try to create processes and organization charts and whatever else you can imagine, but in the end it is really the people that need to come together and that's where **communication** comes into play.
Fortunately it seems like the message reached upper levels as we (employees) have been invited to a two-day workshop, especially focusing on the culture of communication.

Some keywords from the course:
- communication needs an active connection; eye contact is vital
- leave enough space for your discussion partner to express his opinions
- do not interrupt
- listening is hard
