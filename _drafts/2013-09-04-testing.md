Getting how to properly unit test your implementation is hard and the learning curve is steep. You already need some time to properly understand the real value of automated testing itself and even longer probably to see the value behind a test-driven approach. Then, once you (at least seem) to understand it, you need practice pratice pratice...

Here's an example of a unit test case I encountered while reviewing some part of the code. I'm going through this, trying to explain where the problems lie and thus - hopefully - I'm able to provide some valuable information. As always, please feel free to add further suggestions, improvements or issues you see!

## Testing that the code runs without exception

**SUT** (= Subject Under Test, basically the method which is being tested/verified for its correctness)

    public List<Entities.Constant> GetConstants(long categoryId)
    {
        GetConstantsReqType request = new GetConstantsReqType();
        request.IdCategoryType = categoryId;
        request.IdCategoryTypeSpecified = true;
    
        ConstantsDictionaryType[] result = generalUtilityClient.GetConstants(request);
    
        if (result.Count() > 0)
            return Mapper.Map<ConstantType[], List<Entities.Constant>>(result[0].Constant);
        else
            return new List<Entities.Constant>();
    }   


**Test**

    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldCallGetConstantsWithoutException()
    {
        mockGeneralUtilityClient.Setup(x => x.GetConstants(It.IsAny<GetConstantsReqType>())).Returns(new ConstantsDictionaryType[0]);
    
        baseWS.GetConstants(It.IsAny<long>());
    }

So what is the issue with this test? What happens when I comment the implementation code and run the test?? What would be the minimum implementation??

    public List<Entities.Constant> GetConstants(long categoryId)
    {
        return null;
    }   

Executing the test...**PASS**. Why?? Because the above written test does not execute any kind of asserts. It tests for the **absence of exceptions**. Is that ok?? Meaningful?? The answer lies in the benefit/information you get/want from this test.

The test

- assures that this piece of code doesn't throw any kind of exception.

But it

- doesn't warn me if someone removes all of the implementation
- breaks when someone would add an method argument validation, throwing a `CategoryNotSupportedException` in case of category ids smaller than 0

Take the following example:

    public List<Entities.Constant> GetConstants(long catId)
    {
        if(catId < 0){
            throw new CategoryNotSupportedException("Category id cannot be less than 0");
        }
        ...
    }

The above test would fail, but not because the implementation is wrong or broken. As such, you'd have to remove it.

So, rather than testing for the **absence** of exceptions, it should better test for the **presence** of exceptions (if available).

### Let's approach in a TDD fashion (with test after?)

When I have to take a look at code which I haven't written by myself I approach as if I'd implement the logic in a TDD fashion, even without knowing exactly what the code itself is supposed to do. Sounds strange, right? The effect: while I approach the implementation with tests, I dive deeper and deeper into the logic behind and start to understand the reasoning that has been applied by the developer.

So let's look at the implementation.

This piece of logic tells me that by default the code should return an empty list, right?

    if (result.Count() > 0)
        return Mapper.Map<ConstantType[], List<Entities.Constant>>(result[0].Constant);
    else
        return new List<Entities.Constant>();

Hence,

**Test Case 1**:

    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldReturnAnEmptyListIfNoConstantsHaveBeenFound()
    {
        // arrange
        var baseWs = new Siag.CGE.BaseWS.WSClient.BaseWS(null, null, null, null, null);

        // act
        var result = baseWs.GetConstants(It.IsAny<long>());

        // assert
        Assert.IsNotNull(result, "Returns an empty list");
    }

**SUT:** (note everything is commented)

    public List<Entities.Constant> GetConstants(long categoryId)
    {
        //GetConstantsReqType request = new GetConstantsReqType();
        //request.IdCategoryType = categoryId;
        //request.IdCategoryTypeSpecified = true;
    
        //ConstantsDictionaryType[] result = generalUtilityClient.GetConstants(request);
    
        //if (result.Count() > 0)
        //    return Mapper.Map<ConstantType[], List<Entities.Constant>>(result[0].Constant);
        //else
            return new List<Entities.Constant>();
    }

> Note that only the required dependencies are being initialized...in this situation no dependency at all, as our implementation only returns a new list and doesn't actually need anything.

**Test Case 1:** PASS

---

This line

    ConstantsDictionaryType[] result = generalUtilityClient.GetConstants(request);

tells me that an an external dependency is used for retrieving "Constants". Hence

**Test 2:**

    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldReturnAListOfConstantObjectsRetrievedFromTheGenericUtilityClient()
    {
        //arrange
        var mockGenericUtilityClient = new Mock<ICGEGeneralUtility>();
        mockGenericUtilityClient
            .Setup(x => x.GetConstants(It.IsAny<GetConstantsReqType>()))
            .Returns(new ConstantsDictionaryType[] {
                new ConstantsDictionaryType(),
                new ConstantsDictionaryType(),
                new ConstantsDictionaryType()
            });
    
        var baseWs = new Siag.CGE.BaseWS.WSClient.BaseWS(null, mockGenericUtilityClient.Object, null, null, null);
    
        //act
        var result = baseWs.GetConstants(It.IsAny<long>());
    
        //assert
        Assert.AreEqual(1, result.Count, "returns 3 elements");
    }

**SUT:**

    public List<Entities.Constant> GetConstants(long categoryId)
    {
        GetConstantsReqType request = new GetConstantsReqType();
        //request.IdCategoryType = categoryId;
        //request.IdCategoryTypeSpecified = true;

        ConstantsDictionaryType[] result = generalUtilityClient.GetConstants(request);

        if (result.Count() > 0)
            return Mapper.Map<ConstantType[], List<Entities.Constant>>(result[0].Constant);
        else
            return new List<Entities.Constant>();
    }

I un-commented only the required parts I'm interested in. Note also that now I need to **create a mock** for the external dependency and pass it to the `BaseWS` object when initializing it.

**Test Case 1:** FAIL  
**Test Case 2:** FAIL

Ohh..**Test Case 1** fails because it now requires the external dependency to be mocked:

    public void ShouldReturnAnEmptyListIfNoConstantsHaveBeenFound()
    {
        var mockGenericUtilityClient = new Mock<ICGEGeneralUtility>();
        var baseWs = new Siag.CGE.BaseWS.WSClient.BaseWS(null, mockGenericUtilityClient.Object, null, null, null);
    
        var result = baseWs.GetConstants(It.IsAny<long>());
    
        Assert.IsNotNull(result, "Returns an empty list");
    }

**Test Case 1:** PASS  
**Test Case 2:** FAIL

Why does "Test Case 2" fail?? Oh, 

    Assert.AreEqual(3, result.Count, "returns 3 elements");

`result.Count` returns 1 while I expected 3. Let's look at the implementation

    ...
    return Mapper.Map<ConstantType[], List<Entities.Constant>>(result[0].Constant);
    ...

See the `result[0].Constant`...it returns the first element returned from the `genericUtilityClient`. Interesting. Immediately questions arise like

- Is that intentional?? Is it a feature?
- The call to the `genericUtilityClient.GetConstants(long)` an argument, so apparently it applies some filtering. What happens if 2 results are being returned?? Is that even possible, should it throw an exception in that case??

Anyway, let's adjust "Test Case 2". I would now become more specific and instead write that it should return the "first" element returned by the `genericUtilityClient`. As such my test implementation varies a bit

**Test Case 2:**

    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldReturnTheFirstConstantRetrievedFromTheGenericUtilityClient()
    {
        //arrange
        var mockGenericUtilityClient = new Mock<ICGEGeneralUtility>();
        mockGenericUtilityClient
            .Setup(x => x.GetConstants(It.IsAny<GetConstantsReqType>()))
            .Returns(new ConstantsDictionaryType[] {
                new ConstantsDictionaryType() { Constant = new ConstantType[] { new ConstantType { Value = "test" } } },
                new ConstantsDictionaryType(),
                new ConstantsDictionaryType()
            });

        var baseWs = new Siag.CGE.BaseWS.WSClient.BaseWS(null, mockGenericUtilityClient.Object, null, null, null);

        //act
        var result = baseWs.GetConstants(It.IsAny<long>());

        //assert
        Assert.AreEqual(1, result.Count, "returns 1 element");
        Assert.AreEqual("test", result.ElementAt(0).Value, "The value should match");
    }

Note that I now verify that the return count matches and that I really get the first element as I'd expect. For being able to do so I need to somehow mark my item return by the `mockGenericUtilityClient` s.t. I can identify it later.

**Test Case 1:** PASS  
**Test Case 2:** PASS

---

We're not finished yet, the `genericUtilityClient.GetConstants(long)` takes an id which is apparently used for filtering (but we actually don't know and don't have to). All we want to verify is that `categoryId` passed to the SUT is correctly forwarded to the `genericUtiltiyClient`.

**Test Case 3:**

    [TestMethod]
    public void ShouldInvokeTheGenericUtilityClientWithTheCorrectCategoryId()
    {
        //arrange
        var categoryId = 123123;
        var mockGenericUtilityClient = new Mock<ICGEGeneralUtility>();
    
        mockGenericUtilityClient
            .Setup(x => x.GetConstants(It.IsAny<GetConstantsReqType>()))
            .Callback(
                (GetConstantsReqType constantType) =>
                {
                    Assert.AreEqual(categoryId, constantType.IdCategoryType);
                    Assert.AreEqual(true, constantType.IdCategoryTypeSpecified);
                })
            .Returns(new ConstantsDictionaryType[] { new ConstantsDictionaryType() });
    
        var baseWs = new Siag.CGE.BaseWS.WSClient.BaseWS(null, mockGenericUtilityClient.Object, null, null, null);
    
        //act
        baseWs.GetConstants(categoryId);
    
        //assert
        mockGenericUtilityClient.Verify(x => x.GetConstants(It.IsAny<GetConstantsReqType>()), Times.Once());
    }

Note that what is verified by the test above is

1. The `genericUtilityClient.GetConstants(...)` is called exactly once
2. It gets invoked with the correct category id `IdCategoryType` and that the boolean flag `IdCategoryTypeSpecified` is correctly set.

The latter is done directly in the mock (in this case using the Moq library). Let's quickly break it apart to explain the single pieces in more detail

This instruction specifies the method that should receive special treatment on the mock

    mockGenericUtilityClient
        .Setup(x => x.GetConstants(It.IsAny<GetConstantsReqType>()))

..the _callback_ is a method that provides the actual implementation of the `GetConstants` method. Inside this "new" implementation I execute the checks on the object that is passed as parameter (by my SUT). 

        .Callback(
            (GetConstantsReqType constantType) =>
            {
                Assert.AreEqual(categoryId, constantType.IdCategoryType);
                Assert.AreEqual(true, constantType.IdCategoryTypeSpecified);
            })

Finally I need to return an empty array to satisfy the minimum required setup for my SUT to run properly.

        .Returns(new ConstantsDictionaryType[] { new ConstantsDictionaryType() });

**SUT**

    public List<Entities.Constant> GetConstants(long categoryId)
    {
        GetConstantsReqType request = new GetConstantsReqType();
        request.IdCategoryType = categoryId;
        request.IdCategoryTypeSpecified = true;

        ConstantsDictionaryType[] result = generalUtilityClient.GetConstants(request);

        if (result.Count() > 0)
            return Mapper.Map<ConstantType[], List<Entities.Constant>>(result[0].Constant);
        else
            return new List<Entities.Constant>();
    }


    **Test Case 1**: PASS  
    **Test Case 2**: PASS  
    **Test Case 3**: PASS

## Conclusion

What should be the résumé out of this?

First of all, by proceeding with a TDD approach you end up with a lot of questions like

- What if that happens?
- Is this even required to be so?? Is it a feature?
- (...)

Answering these questions along the way let further tests emerge and your implementation will get adapted to fulfill those tests and therefore evolve throughout these cycles. In the end you have not only more tests but also better ones.
