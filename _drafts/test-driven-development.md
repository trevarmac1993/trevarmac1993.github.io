Stuff we've covered

- Coding Dojo
- Kata
- Differences Integration, Functional and Unit Test
  - TDD <> Unit Testing
  - TDD is the tool to "generate" Unit tests
  - What is a Unit test, what not? (Doesn't have to do with the usage of the Unit testing suites available in IDEs)
  - In a functional test you test a set of units and mock out DB access or external dependencies
  - Definition of the Unit
  - In a unit test you verify the unit (i.e. method) in isolation as much as possible.
    - techniques: subclassing, extracting interfaces etc... 
- Self testing code is market standard (not subject to discussion) 
- Baby Steps
- TDD Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
- Test-Driven-DESIGN: Refactoring
  - Use build-in IDE tools whenever possible (Eclipse Refactoring) 
- Useful Plugins
  - Versioning to be able to quickly go back (either some fully-fledged version control, but also Eclipse local histry or VS AutoHistory)
  - Eclipse: Eclemma for code coverage and Infinitest or JUnitMax (commercial) for automatically executing all tests when saving
