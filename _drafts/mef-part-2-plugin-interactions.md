Intro...

This is the 2nd part in a series of MEF posts:

1. MEF Part 1: The Basics
1. MEF Part 2: Plugin Interactions

The focus in this post is to go a little bit further than part 1, exploring potential ways of letting plugins contribute to an application menu which is a common case and second how these extension can then interact with views provided by other plugins which are currently loaded.

## Contributing to the menu
Contibuting to the application menu is a fundamental functionality a plugin-based architecture needs to provide.

In order to establish a proper interaction with other views we need

- define an interface that represents the view and its data input and output; other dependencies can then program against this interface
