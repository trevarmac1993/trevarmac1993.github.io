[Once again](/blog/2012/04/qcon-london-my-personal-recap/) I had the pleasure (thx to [my employer](http://www.siag.it)) to be part of this years [QCon in London](http://qconlondon.com/london-2014). This post serves as a way to summarize my impressions, the take aways and as an "aid to my memory" :).

First of all, I love London! It was actually the third time I was there for about a week and it's always again awesome. And obviously I love QCon, because there are so many high-quality speakers, because of it's international culture, the presence of big and small companies, because of it's "neutrality" and diversity in the presented architectures and technologies. Rarely there are companies or sales people trying to sell you **their architecture, their products** because **they** can help you solve all of your problems. No, there are people like you and me (well, slightly more popular ;)) that tell you their story, how they approached a certain problem, or they simply [talk about their life so far and what they think the future will bring to us](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/) :)  
At this year's conference I test-drove [Slack](https://slack.com/) by live-streaming my notes from the conference to my colleagues (at home in Italy) in a dedicated a #qcon2014 channel.

Some did take the offer and followed actively, others simply ignored it (which is fine as well). So in this post I'm trying to make some sense out of my chat-monologue..

## Problem Solving and Decision Making in Software Development

On Monday I participated in Linda Rising's talk about the people-aspect in the software development process. The day was split into two parts, in the morning we talked about the problem solving and decision making process about which [I already posted here](/blog/2014/03/decision-making-and-problem-solving/).  
In the afternoon, Linda talked about _Fearless Change: Patterns for Introducing New Ideas_. Introducing new ideas into a corporation is not always quite easy, especially if you're a larger organization (like we currently are ~150 people).

What I already experienced by myself multiple times during my professional career so far, is that - instead of what you would assume - too often **decisions aren't taken out of a rational process**, where people sit together, thinking about a given problem to deduce a solution to the best of their knowledge. No, it literally boils down to whether "you offered the coffee the day before" or with whom a given person usually goes out for lunch and hence is more confident with.

Sounds horrible, doesn't it? But that was exactly the message Linda tried to bring to her audience. And if you think about your organization, about certain decisions that have been taken: totally impossible they have been taken as a consequence of a rational process. As such, Linda provided a toolkit, patterns or a framework for introducing new ideas by means of such non-rational techniques like:

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
  <tr>
     <th>Pattern</th>
     <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Evangelist</td>
    <td>To begin to introduce the new idea into your organization, do everything you can to share your passion for it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Brown bag</td>
    <td>Use the time when people normally eat lunch to provide a convenient and relaxed setting for hearing about the new idea.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>...</td>
     <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These are just some of a series of [fearless change patterns](http://fearlesschangepatterns.com/).
