ETH Zurich published an interesting study, conducting an experiment of developing an application for the four major platforms that are currently available, comparing different aspects of the development of a mobile application like development time, productivity, tools, subjective grading etc.

The native vs. hybrid vs. web is an ongoing discussion also at our company. There are always again studies emerging on the web such as the recently published [developer survey from Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com/surveys/global-developer-survey-2013.aspx). 


Also ETH Zurich conducted an interesting study, comparing different aspects of the development of a mobile application for different platforms, namely iOS, Android, WP7 and the web with jQuery Mobile.

The native vs. hybrid vs. web is an ongoing discussion also at our company. 

## The Study

As part of a study named "Informing the Design of New Mobile Development Methods and Tools" they conducted a 14 weeks experiment with 4 developers in order to understand the engineering problems when developing applications for the major mobile platforms.

>  [...] we conducted a 14-week experiment with four developers. Using a diary study, we analysed commonalities and differences between various native mobile and web-based approaches including the different kinds of tasks and the effort expended on them. We discuss implications for design and describe our current work towards better supporting multi-platform development based on our findings.

The study covered the development of an application on **iOS, Android, WP7** and the web with **jQuery Mobile**. Fig 1 shows the distribution of the experiences with each of the platforms by developer.

## Comments

- only 4 devs (-> 2 of them 50% WP7 focused)
