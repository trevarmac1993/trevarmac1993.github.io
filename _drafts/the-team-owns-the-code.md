I guess it was around the year 2000 when eXtreme Programming came out, including a list of **12 practices** based upon their **values**. I remember when I first got in touch with them during my studies at the university. They seem obvious when you read them, as it often happens, but still they totally are not. Unfortunately I always again encounter behaviors which go in the opposite direction which is why I'd like to highlight them here again.

These values and practices are inevitable for good team work and really should be common sense.

Being not sure whether you know about them, here's a quick outline.

## Values

XP is based upon 5 values which I list below, directly taken from the [official site](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html).

**Simplicity -** We will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. This will maximize the value created for the investment made to date. We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs. 

**Communication -** Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

**Feedback -** We will take every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working software. We demonstrate our software early and often then listen carefully and make any changes needed. We will talk about the project and adapt our process to it, not the other way around.

**Respect -** Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member. Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm. Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa. Management respects our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work.

**Courage -** We will tell the truth about progress and estimates. We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed. We don't fear anything because no one ever works alone. We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.

Read them? Are they comprehensible? If not, read them again. For the purpose of this blog post, these are the takeaways:

- we will create something we are proud of 
- we take every iteration commitment seriously
- everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a **valued team member**
- everyone contributes **value**

## Practices

Beside these **values** there are the [XP practices or rules](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html).


## ...

- you're not motivated
- apparently you're "the only who works" and you actively let the team know that
- you criticise often and regularly
- you don't contribute, not to the stand-ups, nor to the overall project
- you are "the" value, not the team
- 


## Poisonous phrases

> Stand up: "Well apparently I'm the only one that really works here, so this is what I did."
--
> Q: "What have you done the past days." A: "I did what was necessary, nothing less, nothing more."


If you want to be a **team player, and you need to be one**, then you have to embrace these things.

**Collective Code Ownership:** No single person "owns" a module. Any developer is expect to be able to work on any part of the codebase at any time.


Collective ownership: No one person owns or is responsible for individual code segments. In turn, the code is reviewed and updated by everyone on the team, allowing for a more collaborative effort.
