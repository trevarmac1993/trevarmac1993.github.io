Quite a while back I got this book from O'Reilly through the Blogger Review Program, but unfortunately never had the time to read it. Last weekend I took a couple of hours and read it.

The "I took a couple of hours and read it" wasn't just a trope, but to be taken literally. As the subtitle says "Get up to speed with Node.JS in a weekend" isn't exaggerated. I had alrady quite some knowledge on programming NodeJS, so I was able to proceed even faster, but also for novices it shouldn't be too hard to follow.

## All the Basics

The book will give you all the basics you need to create your own application. While it initially starts by introducing the basic NodeJS concepts, its strengths and weaknesses, it quickly gets up to spead. As such, already after the first chapter, you will know

- how to download, install and setup your NodeJS application
- how to use NPM, the NodeJS package manager
- ExpressJS, probably the most used NodeJS application framework for developing NodeJS web apps
- how to structure your code properly, by creating and exporting small modules
- how to submit a basic form to your NodeJS backend and
- how to use Mongoose to store the corresponding data in a MongoDB database using MongoLab (a corresponding cloud provider).

Quite a lot for the first chapter, isn't it. Well, although everything is described clearly, especially for beginners it might be a little hard to follow initially. But don't be afraid as things like persistence etc get explained more detailed in a dedicated chapter.

## Testing, Functional Programming, Real-Time,...

After the introductory chapter, the author briefly stresses the importance of TDD and unit testing in the NodeJS world, outlining some small examples. He then talks about functional programming, how it differs from the classical object oriented one and why it might be better suited for NodeJS programming.

He dedicates an entire chapter on persistence with MongoDB, guiding through the installation and setup process and showing in a very detailed manner how to store and retrieve data properly.  
This is also the chapter where the author shows how to build a REST api using Express and MongoDB.



## Conclusion and Résumé
