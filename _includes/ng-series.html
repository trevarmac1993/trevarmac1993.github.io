  This article is part of my <strong>"Learning NG" series</strong>, presenting some of my adventures while learning Angular. Check out the <a href="/blog/2014/11/learning-ng-series-intro/">series intro and other articles</a>. <strong>Note,</strong> I'm an Angular newbie, so I'm more than happy for any kind of feedback and improvement suggestions from more experienced people than me.
